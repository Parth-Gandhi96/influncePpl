                    <h3>Fundamental Techniques in Handling People</h3>
                    <p>1 - ﬁIF YOU WANT TO GATHER HONEY, DON™T KICK OVER THE BEEHIVEﬂ</p>
                    <p>On May 7, 1931, the most sensational manhunt New York City had ever known had come to its climax.
                        After weeks of search, ﬁTwo Gunﬂ Crowley - the killer, the gunman who didn™t smoke or drink -
                        was at bay, trapped in his sweetheart™s apartment on West End Avenue.</p>
                    <p>
                        One hundred and fifty policemen and detectives laid siege to his top-floor hideway. They chopped
                        holes in the roof; they tried to smoke out Crowley, the ﬁcop killer,ﬂ with tear-gas. Then they
                        mounted their machine guns on surrounding buildings, and for more than an hour one of New York™s
                        fine residential areas reverberated with the crack of pistol fire and the rut-tat-tat of machine
                        guns. Crowley, crouching behind an over-stuffed chair, fired incessantly at the police. Ten
                        thousand excited people watched the battle. Nothing like it had ever been seen before on the
                        sidewalks of New York.</p>
                    <p>
                        When Crowley was captured, Police Commissioner E. P. Mulrooney declared that the two-gun
                        desperado was one of the most dangerous criminals ever encountered in the history of New York.
                        ﬁHe will kill,ﬂ said the Commissioner, ﬁat the drop of a feather.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        But how did ﬁTwo Gunﬂ Crowley regard himself? We know, because while the police were firing into
                        his apartment, he wrote a letter addressed ﬁTo whom it may concern, ﬂ And, as he wrote, the
                        blood flowing from his wounds left a crimson trail on the paper. In this letter Crowley said:
                        ﬁUnder my coat is a weary heart, but a kind one - one that would do nobody any harm.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        A short time before this, Crowley had been having a necking party with his girlfriend on a
                        country road out on Long Island. Suddenly a policeman walked up to the car and said: ﬁLet me see
                        your license.ﬂ Without saying a word, Crowley drew his gun and cut the policeman down with a
                        shower of lead. As the dying officer fell, Crowley leaped out of the car, grabbed the officer™s
                        revolver, and fired another bullet into the prostrate body. And that was the killer who said:
                        ﬁUnder my coat is a 25</p>
                    <p>weary heart, but a kind one - one that would do nobody any harm.™</p>
                    <p>
                        Crowley was sentenced to the electric chair. When he arrived at the death house in Sing Sing,
                        did he say, ﬁThis is what I get for killing peopleﬂ? No, he said: ﬁThis is what I get for
                        defending myself.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        The point of the story is this: ﬁTwo Gunﬂ Crowley didn™t blame himself for anything.</p>
                    <p>
                        Is that an unusual attitude among criminals? If you think so, listen to this:</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁI have spent the best years of my life giving people the lighter pleasures, helping them have a
                        good time, and all I get is abuse, the existence of a hunted man.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        That™s Al Capone speaking. Yes, America™s most notorious Public Enemy- the most sinister gang
                        leader who ever shot up Chicago. Capone didn™t condemn himself. He actually regarded himself as
                        a public benefactor - an unappreciated and misunderstood public benefactor.</p>
                    <p>
                        And so did Dutch Schultz before he crumpled up under gangster bullets in Newark. Dutch Schultz,
                        one of New York™s most notorious rats, said in a newspaper interview that he was a public
                        benefactor. And he believed it.</p>
                    <p>
                        I have had some interesting correspondence with Lewis Lawes, who was warden of New York™s
                        infamous Sing Sing prison for many years, on this subject, and he declared that ﬁfew of the
                        criminals in Sing Sing regard themselves as bad men. They are just as human as you and I. So
                        they rationalize, they explain. They can tell you why they had to crack a safe or be quick on
                        the trigger finger. Most of them attempt by a form of reasoning, fallacious or logical, to
                        justify their antisocial acts even to themselves, consequently stoutly maintaining that they
                        should never have been imprisoned at all.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        If Al Capone, ﬁTwo Gunﬂ Crowley, Dutch Schultz, and the desperate men and women behind prison
                        walls don™t blame themselves for anything, what about the people with whom you and I come in
                        contact?</p>
                    <p>
                        John Wanamaker, founder of the stores that bear his name, once confessed: ﬁI learned thirty
                        years ago that it is foolish to scold. I have enough trouble overcoming my own limitations
                        without fretting over the fact that God has not seen fit to 26</p>
                    <p>distribute evenly the gift of intelligence.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        Wanamaker learned this lesson early, but I personally had to blunder through this old world for
                        a third of a century before it even began to dawn upon me that ninety-nine times out of a
                        hundred, people don™t criticize themselves for anything, no matter how wrong it may be.</p>
                    <p>
                        Criticism is futile because it puts a person on the defensive and usually makes them strive to
                        justify themselves. Criticism is dangerous, because it wounds a person™s precious pride, hurts
                        their sense of importance, and arouses resentment.</p>
                    <p>
                        B. F. Skinner, the world-famous psychologist, proved through his experiments that an animal
                        rewarded for good behavior will learn much more rapidly and retain what it learns far more
                        effectively than an animal punished for bad behavior. Later studies have shown that the same
                        applies to humans. By criticizing, we do not make lasting changes and often incur
                        resentment.</p>
                    <p>
                        Hans Selye, another great psychologist, said, ﬁAs much as we thirst for approval, we dread
                        condemnation,ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        The resentment that criticism engenders can demoralize employees, family members and friends,
                        and still not correct the situation that has been condemned.</p>
                    <p>George B. Johnston of Enid, Oklahoma, is the safety coordinator for an engineering company, One
                        of his responsibilities is to see that employees wear their hard hats whenever they are on the
                        job in the field. He reported that whenever he came across workers who were not wearing hard
                        hats, he would tell them with a lot of authority of the regulation and that they must comply. As
                        a result he would get sullen acceptance, and often after he left, the workers would remove the
                        hats.</p>
                    <p>
                        He decided to try a different approach. The next time he found some of the workers not wearing
                        their hard hat, he asked if the hats were uncomfortable or did not fit properly. Then he
                        reminded the men in a pleasant tone of voice that the hat was designed to protect them from
                        injury and suggested that it always be worn on the job. The result was increased compliance with
                        the regulation with no resentment or emotional upset.</p>
                    <p>
                        You will find examples of the futility of criticism bristling on a thousand pages of history,
                        Take, for example, the famous quarrel between Theodore Roosevelt and 27</p>
                    <p>President Taft - a quarrel that split the Republican party, put Woodrow Wilson in the White
                        House, and wrote bold, luminous lines across the First World War and altered the flow of
                        history. Let™s review the facts quickly. When Theodore Roosevelt stepped out of the White House
                        in 1908, he supported Taft, who was elected President. Then Theodore Roosevelt went off to
                        Africa to shoot lions. When he returned, he exploded. He denounced Taft for his conservatism,
                        tried to secure the nomination for a third term himself, formed the Bull Moose party, and all
                        but demolished the G.O.P. In the election that followed, William Howard Taft and the Republican
                        party carried only two states - Vermont and Utah. The most disastrous defeat the party had ever
                        known.</p>
                    <p>
                        Theodore Roosevelt blamed Taft, but did President Taft blame himself? Of course not, With tears
                        in his eyes, Taft said: ﬁI don™t see ho</p>
                    <p>I could have done any differently from what I have.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        Who was to blame? Roosevelt or Taft? Frankly, I don™t know, and I don™t care. The point I am
                        trying to make is that all of Theodore Roosevelt™s criticism didn™t persuade Taft that he was
                        wrong. It merely made Taft strive to justify himself and to reiterate with tears in his eyes: ﬁI
                        don™t see how I could have done any differently from what I have.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        Or, take the Teapot Dome oil scandal. It kept the newspapers ringing with indignation in the
                        early 1920s. It rocked the nation! Within the memory of living men, nothing like it had ever
                        happened before in American public life. Here are the bare facts of the scandal:</p>
                    <p>
                        Albert B. Fall, secretary of the interior in Harding™s cabinet, was entrusted with the leasing
                        of government oil reserves at Elk Hill and Teapot Dome - oil reserves that had been set aside
                        for the future use of the Navy. Did secretary Fall permit competitive bidding? No sir. He handed
                        the fat, juicy contract outright to his friend Edward L. Doheny. And what did Doheny do? He gave
                        Secretary Fall what he was pleased to call a ﬁloanﬂ of one hundred thousand dollars. Then, in a
                        high-handed manner, Secretary Fall ordered United States Marines into the district to drive off
                        competitors whose adjacent wells were sapping oil out of the Elk Hill reserves. These
                        competitors, driven off their ground at the ends of guns and bayonets, rushed into courtŠand
                        blew the lid off the Teapot Dome scandal. A stench arose so vile that it ruined the Harding
                        Administration, nauseated an entire nation, threatened to wreck the Republican party, and put
                        Albert B. Fall behind prison bars.</p>
                    <p>28</p>
                    <p>Fall was condemned viciouslyŠcondemned as few men in public life have ever been. Did he repent?
                        Never! Years later Herbert Hoover intimated in a public speech that President Harding™s death
                        had been due to mental anxiety and worry because a friend had betrayed him. When Mrs. Fall heard
                        that, she sprang from her chair, she wept, she shook her fists at fate and screamed: "What!
                        Harding betrayed by Fall? No! My husband never betrayed anyone. This whole house full of gold
                        would not tempt my husband to do wrong. He is the one who has been betrayed and led to the
                        slaughter and crucified.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        There you are; human nature in action, wrongdoers, blaming everybody but themselves. We are all
                        like that. So when you and I are tempted to criticize someone tomorrow, let™s remember Al
                        Capone, ﬁTwo Gunﬂ Crowley and Albert Fall. Let™s realize that criticisms are like homing
                        pigeons. They always return home. Let™s realize that the person we are going to correct and
                        condemn will probably justify himself or herself, and condemn us in return; or, like the gentle
                        Taft, will say: ﬁI don™t see how I could have done any differently from what I have.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        On the morning of April 15, 1865, Abraham Lincoln lay dying in a hall bedroom of a cheap lodging
                        house directly across the street from Ford™s Theater, where John Wilkes Booth had shot him.
                        Lincoln™s long body lay stretched diagonally across a sagging bed that was too short for him. A
                        cheap reproduction of Rosa Bonheur™s famous painting The Horse Fair hung above the bed, and a
                        dismal gas jet flickered yellow light.</p>
                    <p>
                        As Lincoln lay dying, Secretary of War Stanton said, ﬁThere lies the most perfect ruler of men
                        that the world has ever seen.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        What was the secret of Lincoln™s success in dealing with people? I studied the life of Abraham
                        Lincoln for ten years and devoted all of three years to writing and rewriting a book entitled
                        Lincoln the Unknown. I believe I have made as detailed and exhaustive a study of Lincoln™s
                        personality and home life as it is possible for any being to make. I made a special study of
                        Lincoln™s method of dealing with people. Did he indulge in criticism? Oh, yes. As a young man in
                        the Pigeon Creek Valley of Indiana, he not only criticized but he wrote letters and poems
                        ridiculing people and dropped these letters on the country roads where they were sure to be
                        found. One of these letters aroused resentments that burned for a lifetime.</p>
                    <p>
                        Even after Lincoln had become a practicing lawyer in Springfield, Illinois, he attacked his
                        opponents openly in letters published in the newspapers. But he did this 29</p>
                    <p>just once too often.</p>
                    <p>
                        In the autumn of 1842 he ridiculed a vain, pugnacious politician by the name of James Shields.
                        Lincoln lamned him through an anonymous letter published in Springfield Journal. The town roared
                        with laughter. Shields, sensitive and proud, boiled with indignation. He found out who wrote the
                        letter, leaped on his horse, started after Lincoln, and challenged him to fight a duel. Lincoln
                        didn™t want to fight. He was opposed to dueling, but he couldn™t get out of it and save his
                        honor. He was given the choice of weapons. Since he had very long arms, he chose cavalry
                        broadswords and took lessons in sword fighting from a West Point graduate; and, on the appointed
                        day, he and Shields met on a sandbar in the Mississippi River, prepared to fight to the death;
                        but, at the last minute, their seconds interrupted and stopped the duel.</p>
                    <p>
                        That was the most lurid personal incident in Lincoln™s life. It taught him an invaluable lesson
                        in the art of dealing with people. Never again did he write an insulting letter. Never again did
                        he ridicule anyone. And from that time on, he almost never criticized anybody for anything.</p>
                    <p>
                        Time after time, during the Civil War, Lincoln put a new general at the head of the Army of the
                        Potomac, and each one in turnŠMcClellan, Pope, Burnside, Hooker, MeadeŠblundered tragically and
                        drove Lincoln to pacing the floor in despair. Half the nation savagely condemned these
                        incompetent generals, but Lincoln, ﬁwith malice toward none, with charity for all,ﬂ held his
                        peace. One of his favorite quotations was ﬁJudge not, that ye be not judged.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        And when Mrs. Lincoln and others spoke harshly of the southern people, Lincoln replied: ﬁDon™t
                        criticize them; they are just what we would be under similar circumstances.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        Yet if any man ever had occasion to criticize, surely it was Lincoln. Let™s take just one
                        illustration:</p>
                    <p>The Battle of Gettysburg was fought during the first three days of July 1863. During the night of
                        July 4, Lee began to retreat southward while storm clouds deluged the country with rain. When
                        Lee reached the Potomac with his defeated army, he found a swollen, impassable river in front of
                        him, and a victorious Union Army behind him. Lee was in a trap. He couldn™t escape. Lincoln saw
                        that. Here was a golden, heaven-sent opportunityŠthe opportunity to capture Lee™s army and end
                        the war 30</p>
                    <p>immediately. So, with a surge of high hope, Lincoln ordered Meade not to call a council of war
                        but to attack Lee immediately. Lincoln telegraphed his orders and then sent a special messenger
                        to Meade demanding immediate action.</p>
                    <p>
                        And what did General Meade do? He did the very opposite of what he was told to do. He called a
                        council of war in direct violation of Lincoln™s orders. He hesitated. He procrastinated. He
                        telegraphed all manner of excuses. He refused point-blank to attack Lee. Finally the waters
                        receded and Lee escaped over the Potomac with his forces.</p>
                    <p>
                        Lincoln was furious, ﬁ What does this mean?ﬂ Lincoln cried to his son Robert. ﬁGreat God! What
                        does this mean? We had them within our grasp, and had only to stretch forth our hands and they
                        were ours; yet nothing that I could say or do could make the army move. Under the circumstances,
                        almost any general could have defeated Lee. If I had gone up there, I could have whipped him
                        myself.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        In bitter disappointment, Lincoln sat down and wrote Meade this letter. And remember, at this
                        period of his life Lincoln was extremely conservative and restrained in his phraseology. So this
                        letter coming from Lincoln in 1863 was tantamount to the severest rebuke.</p>
                    <p>
                        My dear General,</p>
                    <p>
                        I do not believe you appreciate the magnitude of the misfortune involved in Lee™s escape. He was
                        within our easy grasp, and to have closed upon him would, in connection with our other late
                        successes, have ended the war. As it is, the war will be prolonged indefinitely. If you could
                        not safely attack Lee last Monday, how can you possibly do so south of the river, when you can
                        take with you very fewŠno more than two-thirds of the force you then had in hand? It would be
                        unreasonable to expect and I do not expect that you can now effect much. Your golden opportunity
                        is gone, and I am distressed immeasurably because of it.</p>
                    <p>
                        What do you suppose Meade did when he read the letter?</p>
                    <p>Meade never saw that letter. Lincoln never mailed it. It was found among his papers after his
                        death.</p>
                    <p>
                        My guess isŠand this is only a guessŠthat after writing that letter, Lincoln looked out of the
                        window and said to himself, ﬁJust a minute. Maybe I ought not to be so 31</p>
                    <p>hasty. It is easy enough for me to sit here in the quiet of the White House and order Meade to
                        attack; but if I had been up at Gettysburg, and if I had seen as much blood as Meade has seen
                        during the last week, and if my ears had been pierced with the screams and shrieks of the
                        wounded and dying, maybe I wouldn™t be so anxious to attack either. If I had Meade™s timid
                        temperament, perhaps I would have done just what he had done. Anyhow, it is water under the
                        bridge now. If I send this letter, it will relieve my feelings, but it will make Meade try to
                        justify himself. It will make him condemn me. It will arouse hard feelings, impair all his
                        further usefulness as a commander, and perhaps force him to resign from the army.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        So, as I have already said, Lincoln put the letter aside, for he had learned by bitter
                        experience that sharp criticisms and rebukes almost invariably end in futility.</p>
                    <p>
                        Theodore Roosevelt said that when he, as President, was confronted with a perplexing problem, he
                        used to lean back and look up at a large painting of Lincoln which hung above his desk in the
                        White House and ask himself, ﬁWhat would Lincoln do if he were in my shoes? How would he solve
                        this problem?ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        The next time we are tempted to admonish somebody, let™s pull a five-dollar bill out of our
                        pocket, look at Lincoln™s picture on the bill, and ask. ﬁHow would Lincoln handle this problem
                        if he had it?ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        Mark Twain lost his temper occasionally and wrote letters that turned the Paper brown. For
                        example, he once wrote to a man who had aroused his ire: ﬁThe thing for you is a burial permit.
                        You have only to speak and I will see that you get it.ﬂ On another occasion he wrote to an
                        editor about a proofreader™s attempts to ﬁimprove my spelling and punctuation.ﬂ He ordered: ﬁSet
                        the matter according to my copy hereafter and see that the proofreader retains his suggestions
                        in the mush of his decayed brain.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        The writing of these stinging letters made Mark Twain feel better. They allowed him to blow off
                        steam, and the letters didn™t do any real harm, because Mark™s wife secretly lifted them out of
                        the mail. They were never sent.</p>
                    <p>
                        Do you know someone you would like to change and regulate and improve? Good! That is fine. I am
                        all in favor of it, but why not begin on yourself? From a purely selfish standpoint, that is a
                        lot more profitable than trying to improve othersŠyes, and a lot less dangerous.</p>
                    <p>32</p>
                    <p> ﬁDon™t complain about the snow on your neighbor™s roof,ﬂ said Confucius, ﬁwhen your own doorstep

                        When I was still young and trying hard to impress people, I wrote a foolish letter to Richard
                        Harding Davis, an author who once loomed large on the literary horizon of America. I was
                        preparing a magazine article about authors, and I asked Davis to tell me about his method of
                        work. A few weeks earlier, I had received a letter from someone with this notation at the
                        bottom: ﬁDictated but not read.ﬂ I was quite impressed. I felt that the writer must be very big
                        and busy and important. I wasn™t the slightest bit busy, but I was eager to make an impression
                        on Richard Harding Davis, so I ended my short note with the words: ﬁDictated but not read.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        He never troubled to answer the letter. He simply returned it to me with this scribbled across
                        the bottom: ﬁYour bad manners are exceeded only by your bad manners.ﬂ True, I had blundered, and
                        perhaps I deserved this rebuke. But, being human, I resented it. I resented it so sharply that
                        when I read of the death of Richard Harding Davis ten years later, the one thought that still
                        persisted in my mindŠI am ashamed to admitŠwas the hurt he had given me.</p>
                    <p>
                        If you and I want to stir up a resentment tomorrow that may rankle across the decades and endure
                        until death, just let us indulge in a little stinging criticismŠno matter how certain we are
                        that it is justified.</p>
                    <p>
                        When dealing with people, let us remember we are not dealing with creatures of logic. We are
                        dealing with creatures of emotion, creatures bristling with prejudices and motivated by pride
                        and vanity.</p>
                    <p>
                        Bitter criticism caused the sensitive Thomas Hardy, one of the finest novelists ever to enrich
                        English literature, to give up forever the writing of fiction. Criticism drove Thomas
                        Chatterton, the English poet, to suicide.</p>

                        Benjamin Franklin, tactless in his youth, became so diplomatic, so adroit at handling people,
                        that he was made American Ambassador to France. The secret of his success? ﬁI will speak ill of
                        no man,ﬂ he said, " . . and speak all the good I know of everybody.ﬂ</p>

                        Bob Hoover, a famous test pilot and frequent performer at air shows, was returning to his home
                        in Los Angeles from an air show in San Diego. As described in the magazine Flight Operations, at
                        three hundred feet in the air, both engines suddenly stopped. By deft maneuvering he managed to
                        land the plane, but it was badly damaged although nobody was hurt.</p>
                    <p>
                        Hoover™s first act after the emergency landing was to inspect the airplane™s fuel. Just as he
                        suspected, the World War II propeller plane he had been flying had been fueled with jet fuel
                        rather than gasoline.</p>
                    <p>
                        Upon returning to the airport, he asked to see the mechanic who had serviced his airplane. The
                        young man was sick with the agony of his mistake. Tears streamed down his face as Hoover
                        approached. He had just caused the loss of a very expensive plane and could have caused the loss
                        of three lives as well.</p>
                    <p>
                        You can imagine Hoover™s anger. One could anticipate the tongue-lashing that this proud and
                        precise pilot would unleash for that carelessness. But Hoover didn™t scold the mechanic; he
                        didn™t even criticize him. Instead, he put his big arm around the man™s shoulder and said, ﬁTo
                        show you I™m sure that you™ll never do this again, I want you to service my F-51 tomorrow.ﬂ</p>

                        Listen, son: I am saying this as you lie asleep, one little paw crumpled under your cheek and
                        the blond curls stickily wet on your damp forehead. I have stolen into your room alone. Just a
                        few minutes ago, as I sat reading my paper in the library, a stifling wave of remorse swept over
                        me. Guiltily I came to your bedside.</p>
                    <p>
                        These are the things I was thinking, son: I had been cross to you. I scolded you as you were
                        dressing for school because you gave your face merely a dab with a towel. I took you to task for
                        not cleaning your shoes. I called out angrily when you threw some of your things on the
                        floor.</p>
                    <p>
                        At breakfast I found fault, too. You spilled things. You gulped down your food. You put your
                        elbows on the table. You spread butter too thick on your bread. And as you started off to play
                        and I made for my train, you turned and waved a hand and called, ﬁGoodbye, Daddy!ﬂ and I
                        frowned, and said in reply, ﬁHold your shoulders back!ﬂ</p>
                    <p>Then it began all over again in the late afternoon. As I came up the road I spied you, down on
                        your knees, playing marbles. There were holes in your stockings. I humiliated you before your

                        buy them you would be more careful! Imagine that, son, from a father!</p>
                    <p>
                        Do you remember, later, when I was reading in the library, how you came in timidly, with a sort
                        of hurt look in your eyes? When I glanced up over my paper, impatient at the interruption, you
                        hesitated at the door. ﬁWhat is it you want?ﬂ I snapped.</p>
                    <p>
                        You said nothing, but ran across in one tempestuous plunge, and threw your arms around my neck
                        and kissed me, and your small arms tightened with an affection that God had set blooming in your
                        heart and which even neglect could not wither. And then you were gone, pattering up the
                        stairs.</p>
                    <p>
                        Well, son, it was shortly afterwards that my paper slipped from my hands and a terrible
                        sickening fear came over me. What has habit been doing to me? The habit 35</p>
                    <p>of finding fault, of reprimandingŠthis was my reward to you for being a boy. It was not that I
                        did not love you; it was that I expected too much of youth. I was measuring you by the yardstick
                        of my own years.</p>
                    <p>
                        And there was so much that was good and fine and true in your character. The little heart of you
                        was as big as the dawn itself over the wide hills. This was shown by your spontaneous impulse to
                        rush in and kiss me good night. Nothing else matters tonight, son. I have come to your bed-side
                        in the darkness, and I have knelt there, ashamed!</p>
                    <p>
                        It is a feeble atonement; I know you would not understand these things if I told them to you
                        during your waking hours. But tomorrow I will be a real daddy! I will chum with you, and suffer
                        when you suffer, and laugh when you laugh. I will bite my tongue when impatient words come. I
                        will keep saying as if it were a ritual: ﬁHe is nothing but a boy - a little boy!ﬂ</p>
                    <p>I am afraid I have visualized you as a man. Yet as I see you now, son, crumpled and weary in your
                        cot, I see that you are still a baby. Yesterday you were in your mother™s arms, your head on her
                        shoulder. I have asked too much, too much.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        Instead of condemning people, let™s try to understand them. Let™s try to figure out why they do
                        what they do. That™s a lot more profitable and intriguing than criticism; and it breeds
                        sympathy, tolerance and kindness. ﬁTo know all is to forgive all.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        As Dr. Johnson said: ﬁGod Himself, sir, does not propose to judge man until the end of his
                        days.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>

                    <p>2 - THE BIG SECRET OF DEALING WITH PEOPLE</p>
                    <p>
                        There is only one way under high heaven to get anybody to do anything. Did you ever stop to
                        think of that? Yes, just one way. And that is by making the other person want to do it.</p>
                    <p>
                        Remember, there is no other way.</p>
                    <p>
                        Of course, you can make someone want to give you their watch by sticking a revolver in their
                        ribs. YOU can make your employees give you cooperationŠuntil your back is turnedŠby threatening
                        to fire them. You can make a child do what you want it to do by a whip or a threat. But these
                        crude methods have sharply undesirable repercussions.</p>
                    <p>
                        The only way I can get you to do anything is by giving you what you want.</p>
                    <p>
                        What do you want?</p>
                    <p>
                        Sigmund Freud said that everything you and I do springs from two motives: the sex urge and the
                        desire to be great.</p>
                    <p>
                        John Dewey, one of America™s most profound philosophers, phrased it a bit differently. Dr. Dewey
                        said that the deepest urge in human nature is ﬁthe desire to be important." Remember that
                        phrase: ﬁthe desire to be important." It is significant. You are going to hear a lot about it in
                        this book.</p>
                    <p>
                        What do you want? Not many things, but the few that you do wish, you crave with an insistence
                        that will not be denied. Some of the things most people want include:</p>
                    <p>
                        1. Health and the preservation of life. 2. Food. 3. Sleep. 4. Money and the things money will
                        buy. 5. Life in the hereafter. 6. Sexual gratification. 7. The well-being of our children. 8. A
                        feeling of importance.</p>
                    <p>Almost all these wants are usually gratifiedŠall except one. But there is one 37</p>
                    <p>longingŠalmost as deep, almost as imperious, as the desire for food or sleepŠwhich is seldom
                        gratified. It is what Freud calls ﬁthe desire to be great.ﬂ It is what Dewey calls the ﬁdesire
                        to be important.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        Lincoln once began a letter saying: ﬁEverybody likes a compliment.ﬂ William James said: "The
                        deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be appreciated." He didn™t speak, mind you,
                        of the ﬁwishﬂ or the ﬁdesireﬂ or the ﬁlongingﬂ to be appreciated. He said the "cravingﬂ to be
                        appreciated.</p>
                    <p>
                        Here is a gnawing and unfaltering human hunger, and the rare individual who honestly satisfies
                        this heart hunger will hold people in the palm of his or her hand and ﬁeven the undertaker will
                        be sorry when he dies.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        The desire for a feeling of importance is one of the chief distinguishing differences between
                        mankind and the animals. To illustrate: When I was a farm boy out in Missouri, my father bred
                        fine Duroc-Jersey hogs and . pedigreed white-faced cattle. We used to exhibit our hogs and
                        white-faced cattle at the country fairs and live-stock shows throughout the Middle West. We won
                        first prizes by the score. My father pinned his blue ribbons on a sheet of white muslin, and
                        when friends or visitors came to the house, he would get out the long sheet of muslin. He would
                        hold one end and I would hold the other while he exhibited the blue ribbons.</p>
                    <p>
                        The hogs didn™t care about the ribbons they had won. But Father did. These prizes gave him a
                        feeling of importance.</p>
                    <p>
                        If our ancestors hadn™t had this flaming urge for a feeling of importance, civilization would
                        have been impossible. Without it, we should have been just about like animals.</p>
                    <p>
                        It was this desire for a feeling of importance that led an uneducated, poverty-stricken grocery
                        clerk to study some law books he found in the bottom of a barrel of household plunder that he
                        had bought for fifty cents. You have probably heard of this grocery clerk. His name was
                        Lincoln.</p>
                    <p>
                        It was this desire for a feeling of importance that inspired Dickens to write his immortal
                        novels. This desire inspired Sir Christoper Wren to design his symphonies in stone. This desire
                        made Rockefeller amass millions that he never spent! And this same desire made the richest
                        family in your town build a house far too large for its 38</p>
                    <p>requirements.</p>
                    <p>
                        This desire makes you want to wear the latest styles, drive the latest cars, and talk about your
                        brilliant children.</p>
                    <p>
                        It is this desire that lures many boys and girls into joining gangs and engaging in criminal
                        activities. The average young criminal, according to E. P. Mulrooney, onetime police
                        commissioner of New York, is filled with ego, and his first request after arrest is for those
                        lurid newspapers that make him out a hero. The disagreeable prospect of serving time seems
                        remote so long as he can gloat over his likeness sharing space with pictures of sports figures,
                        movie and TV stars and politicians.</p>
                    <p>
                        If you tell me how you get your feeling of importance, I™ll tell you what you are. That
                        determines your character. That is the most significant thing about you. For example, John D.
                        Rockefeller got his feeling of importance by giving money to erect a modern hospital in Peking,
                        China, to care for millions of poor people whom he had never seen and never would see.
                        Dillinger, on the other hand, got his feeling of importance by being a bandit, a bank robber and
                        killer. When the FBI agents were hunting him, he dashed into a farmhouse up in Minnesota and
                        said, ﬁI™m Dillinger!ﬂ He was proud of the fact that he was Public Enemy Number One. ﬁI™m not
                        going to hurt you, but I™m Dillinger!ﬂ he said.</p>
                    <p>
                        Yes, the one significant difference between Dillinger and Rockefeller is how they got their
                        feeling of importance.</p>
                    <p>
                        History sparkles with amusing examples of famous people struggling for a feeling of importance.
                        Even George Washington wanted to be called ﬁHis Mightiness, the President of the United Statesﬂ;
                        and Columbus pleaded for the title ﬁAdmiral of the Ocean and Viceroy of India.ﬂ Catherine the
                        Great refused to open letters that were not addressed to ﬁHer Imperial Majestyﬂ; and Mrs.
                        Lincoln, in the White House, turned upon Mrs. Grant like a tigress and shouted, ﬁHow dare you be
                        seated in my presence until I invite you!ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        Our millionaires helped finance Admiral Byrd™s expedition to the Antarctic in 1928 with the
                        understanding that ranges of icy mountains would be named after them; and Victor Hugo aspired to
                        have nothing less than the city of Paris renamed in his honor. Even Shakespeare, mightiest of
                        the mighty, tried to add luster to his name by procuring a coat of arms for his family.</p>
                    <p>39</p>
                    <p>People sometimes became invalids in order to win sympathy and attention, and get a feeling of
                        importance. For example, take Mrs. McKinley. She got a feeling of importance by forcing her
                        husband, the President of the United States, to neglect important affairs of state while he
                        reclined on the bed beside her for hours at a time, his arm about her, soothing her to sleep.
                        She fed her gnawing desire for attention by insisting that he remain with her while she was
                        having her teeth fixed, and once created a stormy scene when he had to leave her alone with the
                        dentist while he kept an appointment with John Hay, his secretary of state.</p>
                    <p>
                        The writer Mary Roberts Rinehart once told me of a bright, vigorous young woman who became an
                        invalid in order to get a feeling of importance. ﬁOne day,ﬂ said Mrs. Rinehart, ﬁthis woman had
                        been obliged to face something, her age perhaps. The lonely years were stretching ahead and
                        there was little left for her to anticipate.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁShe took to her bed; and for ten years her old mother traveled to the third floor and back,
                        carrying trays, nursing her. Then one day the old mother, weary with service, lay down and died.
                        For some weeks, the invalid languished; then she got up, put on her clothing, and resumed living
                        again.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        Some authorities declare that people may actually go insane in order to find, in the dreamland
                        of insanity, the feeling of importance that has been denied them in the harsh world of reality.
                        There are more patients suffering from mental diseases in the United States than from all other
                        diseases combined.</p>
                    <p>
                        What is the cause of insanity?</p>
                    <p>Nobody can answer such a sweeping question, but we know that certain diseases, such as syphilis,
                        break down and destroy the brain cells and result in insanity. In fact, about one-half of all
                        mental diseases can be attributed to such physical causes as brain lesions, alcohol, toxins and
                        injuries. But the other halfŠand this is the appalling part of the storyŠthe other half of the
                        people who go insane apparently have nothing organically wrong with their brain cells. In
                        post-mortem examinations, when their brain tissues are studied under the highest-powered
                        microscopes, these tissues are found to be apparently just as healthy as yours and mine.</p>
                    <p>
                        Why do these people go insane?</p>
                    <p>I put that question to the head physician of one of our most important psychiatric 40</p>
                    <p>hospitals. This doctor, who has received the highest honors and the most coveted awards for his
                        knowledge of this subject, told me frankly that he didn™t know why people went insane. Nobody
                        knows for sure, but he did say that many people who go insane find in insanity a feeling of
                        importance that they were unable to achieve in the world of reality. Then he told me this
                        story:</p>
                    <p>
                        "I have a patient right now whose marriage proved to be a tragedy. She wanted love, sexual
                        gratification, children and social prestige, but life blasted all her hopes. Her husband didn™t
                        love her. He refused even to eat with her and forced her to serve his meals in his room
                        upstairs. She had no children, no social standing. She went insane; and, in her imagination, she
                        divorced her husband and resumed her maiden name. She now believes she has married into English
                        aristocracy, and she insists on being called Lady Smith.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁAnd as for children, she imagines now that she has had a new child every night. Each time I
                        call on her she says: ‚Doctor, I had a baby last night.™ "</p>
                    <p>
                        Life once wrecked all her dream ships on the sharp rocks of reality; but in the sunny, fantasy
                        isles of insanity, all her barkentines race into port with canvas billowing and winds singing
                        through the masts.</p>
                    <p>
                        " Tragic? Oh, I don™t know." Her physician said to me: "If I could stretch out my hand and
                        restore her sanity, I wouldn™t do it. She™s much happier as she is."</p>
                    <p>
                        If some people are so hungry for a feeling of importance that they actually go insane to get it,
                        imagine what miracle you and I can achieve by giving people honest appreciation this side of
                        insanity.</p>

                        year (when there was no income tax and a person earning fifty dollars a week was considered well
                        off) was Charles Schwab, He had been picked by Andrew Carnegie to become the first president of
                        the newly formed United States Steel Company in 1921, when Schwab was only thirty-eight years
                        old. (Schwab later left U.S. Steel to take over the then-troubled Bethlehem Steel Company, and
                        he rebuilt it into one of the most profitable companies in America.)</p>
                    <p>Why did Andrew Carnegie pay a million dollars a year, or more than three thousand dollars a day,
                        to Charles Schwab? Why? Because Schwab was a genius? No. Because he knew more about the
                        manufacture of steel than other people? Nonsense. 41</p>
                    <p>Charles Schwab told me himself that he had many men working for him who knew more about the
                        manufacture of steel than he did.</p>
                    <p>
                        Schwab says that he was paid this salary largely because of his ability to deal with people. I
                        asked him how he did it. Here is his secret set down in his own wordsŠwords that ought to be
                        cast in eternal bronze and hung in every home and school, every shop and office in the
                        landŠwords that children ought to memorize instead of wasting their time memorizing the
                        conjugation of Latin verbs or the amount of the annual rainfall in BrazilŠwords that will all
                        but transform your life and mine if we will only live them:</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁI consider my ability to arouse enthusiasm among my people,ﬂ said Schwab, ﬁthe greatest asset I
                        possess, and the way to develop the best that is in a person is by appreciation and
                        encouragement.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁThere is nothing else that so kills the ambitions of a person as criticisms from superiors. I
                        never criticize anyone. I believe in giving a person incentive to work. So I am anxious to
                        praise but loath to find fault. If I like anything, I am hearty in my approbation and lavish in
                        my praise. "</p>
                    <p>
                        That is what Schwab did. But what do average people do? The exact opposite. If they don™t like a
                        thing, they bawl out their subordinates; if they do like it, they say nothing. As the old
                        couplet says: ﬁOnce I did bad and that I heard ever. Twice I did good, but that I heard
                        never.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁIn my wide association in life, meeting with many and great people in various parts of the
                        world,ﬂ Schwab declared, ﬁI have yet to find the person, however great or exalted their station,
                        who did not do better work and put forth greater effort under a spirit of approval than they
                        would ever do under a spirit of criticism.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        That he said, frankly, was one of the outstanding reasons for the phenomenal success of Andrew
                        Carnegie. Carnegie praised his associates publicly as well as prvately.</p>
                    <p>Carnegie wanted to praise his assistants even on his tombstone. He wrote an epitaph for himself
                        which read: ﬁHere lies one who knew how to get around him men who were cleverer than
                        himself:ﬂ</p>
                    <p>42</p>
                    <p>Sincere appreciation was one of the secrets of the first John D. Rockefeller™s success in
                        handling men. For example, when one of his partners, Edward T. Bedford, lost a million dollars
                        for the firm by a bad buy in South America, John D. might have criticized; but he knew Bedford
                        had done his best - and the incident was closed. So Rockefeller found something to praise; he
                        congratulated Bedford because he had been able to save 60 percent of the money he had invested.
                        ﬁThat™s splendid," said Rockefeller. ﬁWe don™t always do as well as that upstairs.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        I have among my clippings a story that I know never happened, but it illustrates a truth, so
                        I™ll repeat it:</p>
                    <p>
                        According to this silly story, a farm woman, at the end of a heavy day™s work, set before her
                        menfolks a heaping pile of hay. And when they indignantly demanded whether she had gone crazy,
                        she replied: ﬁWhy, how did I know you™d notice? I™ve been cooking for you men for the last
                        twenty years and in all that time I ain™t heard no word to let me know you wasn™t just eating
                        hay.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        When a study was made a few years ago on runaway wives, what do you think was discovered to be
                        the main reason wives ran away? It was ﬁlack of appreciation.ﬂ And I™d bet that a similar study
                        made of runaway husbands would come out the same way. We often take our spouses so much for
                        granted that we never let them know we appreciate them.</p>
                    <p>A member of one of our classes told of a request made by his wife. She and a group of other women
                        in her church were involved in a self-improvement program. She asked her husband to help her by
                        listing six things he believed she could do to help her become a better wife. He reported to the
                        class: ﬁI was surprised by such a request. Frankly, it would have been easy for me to list six
                        things I would like to change about herŠmy heavens, she could have listed a thousand things she
                        would like to change about meŠbut I didn™t. I said to her, ‚Let me think about it and give you
                        an answer in the morning.™</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁThe next morning I got up very early and called the florist and had them send six red roses to
                        my wife with a note saying: ‚I can™t think of six things I would like to change about you. I
                        love you the way you are.™</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁWhen I arrived at home that evening, who do you think greeted me at the door: That™s right. My
                        wife! She was almost in tears. Needless to say, I was extremely glad I had not criticized her as
                        she had requested. 43</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁThe following Sunday at church, after she had reported the results of her assignment, several
                        women with whom she had been studying came up to me and said, ‚That was the most considerate
                        thing I have ever heard.™ It was then I realized the power of appreciation.ﬂ</p>

                        Florenz Ziegfeld, the most spectacular producer who ever dazzled Broadway, gained his reputation
                        by his subtle ability to ﬁglorify the American girl.ﬂ Time after time, he took drab little
                        creatures that no one ever looked at twice and transformed them on the stage into glamorous
                        visions of mystery and seduction. Knowing the value of appreciation and confidence, he made
                        women feel beautiful by the sheer power of his gallantry and consideration. He was practical: he
                        raised the salary of chorus girls from thirty dollars a week to as high as one hundred and
                        seventy-five. And he was also chivalrous; on opening night at the Follies, he sent telegrams to
                        the stars in the cast, and he deluged every chorus girl in the show with American Beauty
                        roses.</p>

                        I once succumbed to the fad of fasting and went for six days and nights without eating. It
                        wasn™t difficult. I was less hungry at the end of the sixth day than I was at the end of the
                        second. Yet I know, as you know, people who would think they had committed a crime if they let
                        their families or employees go for six days without food; but they will let them go for six
                        days, and six weeks, and sometimes sixty years without giving them the hearty appreciation that
                        they crave almost as much as they crave food.</p>

                        When Alfred Lunt, one of the great actors of his time, played the leading role in Reunion in
                        Vienna, he said, ﬁThere is nothing I need so much as nourishment for my self-esteem.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        We nourish the bodies of our children and friends and employees, but how seldom do we nourish
                        their self-esteem? We provide them with roast beef and potatoes to build energy, but we neglect
                        to give them kind words of appreciation that would sing in their memories for years like the
                        music of the morning stars.</p>
                    <p>
                        Paul Harvey, in one of his radio broadcasts, ﬁThe Rest of the Story,ﬂ told how showing sincere
                        appreciation can change a person™s life. He reported that years ago a teacher in Detroit asked
                        Stevie Morris to help her find a mouse that was lost in the classroom. You see, she appreciated
                        the fact that nature had given Stevie something no one else in the room had. Nature had given
                        Stevie a remarkable pair of ears to 44</p>
                    <p>compensate for his blind eyes. But this was really the first time Stevie had been shown
                        appreciation for those talented ears. Now, years later, he says that this act of appreciation
                        was the beginning of a new life. You see, from that time on he developed his gift of hearing and
                        went on to become, under the stage name of Stevie Wonder, one of the great pop singers and and
                        songwriters of the seventies.</p>
                    <p>
                        Some readers are saying right now as they read these lines: ﬁOh, phooey! Flattery! Bear oil!
                        I™ve tried that stuff. It doesn™t work - not with intelligent people.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        Of course flattery seldom works with discerning people. It is shallow, selfish and insincere. It
                        ought to fail and it usually does. True, some people are so hungry, so thirsty, for appreciation
                        that they will swallow anything, just as a starving man will eat grass and fishworms.</p>
                    <p>
                        Even Queen Victoria was susceptible to flattery. Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli confessed that
                        he put it on thick in dealing with the Queen. To use his exact words, he said he ﬁspread it on
                        with a trowel.ﬂ But Disraeli was one of the most polished, deft and adroit men who ever ruled
                        the far-flung British Empire. He was a genius in his line. What would work for him wouldn™t
                        necessarily work for you and me. In the long run, flattery will do you more harm than good.
                        Flattery is counterfeit, and like counterfeit money, it will eventually get you into trouble if
                        you pass it to someone else.</p>
                    <p>The difference between appreciation and flattery? That is simple. One is sincere and the other
                        insincere. One comes from the heart out; the other from the teeth out. One is unselfish; the
                        other selfish. One is universally admired; the other universally condemned.</p>
                    <p>
                        I recently saw a bust of Mexican hero General Alvaro Obregon in the Chapultepec palace in Mexico
                        City. Below the bust are carved these wise words from General Obregon™s philosophy: ﬁDon™t be
                        afraid of enemies who attack you. Be afraid of the friends who flatter you.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>No! No! No! I am not suggesting flattery! Far from it. I™m talking about a new way of life. Let
                        me repeat. I am talking about a new way of life.</p>

                        King George V had a set of six maxims displayed on the walls of his study at Buckingham Palace.
                        One of these maxims said: ﬁTeach me neither to proffer nor receive cheap praise.ﬂ That™s all
                        flattery is - cheap praise. I once read a definition of 45</p>
                    <p>flattery that may be worth repeating: ﬁFlattery is telling the other person precisely what they
                        think about themselves.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁUse what language you will,ﬂ said Ralph Waldo Emerson, ﬁyou can never say anything but what you
                        are ."</p>
                    <p>
                        If all we had to do was flatter, everybody would catch on and we should all be experts in human
                        relations.</p>
                    <p>
                        When we are not engaged in thinking about some definite problem, we usually spend about 95
                        percent of our time thinking about ourselves. Now, if we stop thinking about ourselves for a
                        while and begin to think of the other person™s good points, we won™t have to resort to flattery
                        so cheap and false that it can be spotted almost before it is out of the mouth.</p>
                    <p>
                        One of the most neglected virtues of our daily existence is appreciation, Somehow, we neglect to
                        praise our son or daughter when he or she brings home a good report card, and we fail to
                        encourage our children when they first succeed in baking a cake or building a birdhouse.</p>
                    <p>Nothing pleases children more than this kind of parental interest and approval.</p>
                    <p>
                        The next time you enjoy filet mignon at the club, send word to the chef that it was excellently
                        prepared, and when a tired salesperson shows you unusual courtesy, please mention it.</p>

                        Every minister, lecturer and public speaker knows the discouragement of pouring himself or
                        herself out to an audience and not receiving a single ripple of appreciative comment. What
                        applies to professionals applies doubly to workers in offices, shops and factories and our
                        families and friends. In our interpersonal relations we should never forget that all our
                        associates are human beings and hunger for appreciation. It is the legal tender that all souls
                        enjoy.</p>
                    <p>
                        Try leaving a friendly trail of little sparks of gratitude on your daily trips. You will be
                        surprised how they will set small flames of friendship that will be rose beacons on your next
                        visit.</p>

                        Pamela Dunham of New Fairfield, Connecticut, had among her responsibilities on her job the
                        supervision of a janitor who was doing a very poor job. The other 46</p>
                    <p>employees would jeer at him and litter the hallways to show him what a bad job he was doing. It
                        was so bad, productive time was being lost in the shop.</p>
                    <p>
                        Without success, Pam tried various ways to motivate this person. She noticed that occasionally
                        he did a particularly good piece of work. She made a point to praise him for it in front of the
                        other people. Each day the job he did all around got better, and pretty soon he started doing
                        all his work efficiently. Now he does an excellent job and other people give him appreciation
                        and recognition. Honest appreciation got results where criticism and ridicule failed.</p>

                        Hurting people not only does not change them, it is never called for. There is an old saying
                        that I have cut out and pasted on my mirror where I cannot help but see it every day:</p>
                    <p>I shall pass this way but once; any good, therefore, that I can do or any kindness that I can
                        show to any human being, let me do it now. Let me not defer nor neglect it, for I shall not pass
                        this way again.</p>
                    <p>
                        Emerson said: ﬁEvery man I meet is my superior in some way, In that, I learn of him.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        If that was true of Emerson, isn™t it likely to be a thousand times more true of you and me?
                        Let™s cease thinking of our accomplishments, our wants. Let™s try to figure out the other
                        person™s good points. Then forget flattery. Give honest, sincere appreciation. Be ﬁhearty in

                        I often went fishing up in Maine during the summer. Personally I am very fond of strawberries
                        and cream, but I have found that for some strange reason, fish prefer worms. So when I went
                        fishing, I didn™t think about what I wanted. I thought about what they wanted. I didn™t bait the
                        hook with strawberries and cream. Rather, I dangled a worm or a grasshopper in front of the fish
                        and said: ﬁWouldn™t you like to have that?ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        Why not use the same common sense when fishing for people?</p>
                    <p>
                        That is what Lloyd George, Great Britain™s Prime Minister during World War I, did. When someone
                        asked him how he managed to stay in power after the other wartime leadersŠWilson, Orlando and
                        ClemenceauŠhad been forgotten, he replied that if his staying on top might be attributed to any
                        one thing, it would be to his having learned that it was necessary to bait the hook to suit the
                        fish.</p>
                    <p>
                        Why talk about what we want? That is childish. Absurd. Of course, you are interested in what you
                        want. You are eternally interested in it. But no one else is. The rest of us are just like you:
                        we are interested in what we want.</p>
                    <p>
                        So the only way on earth to influence other people is to talk about what they want and show them
                        how to get it.</p>
                    <p>Remember that tomorrow when you are trying to get somebody to do something. If, for example, you
                        don™t want your children to smoke, don™t preach at them, and don™t talk about what you want; but
                        show them that cigarettes may keep them from making the basketball team or winning the
                        hundred-yard dash.</p>
                    <p>
                        This is a good thing to remember regardless of whether you are dealing with children or calves
                        or chimpanzees. For example: one day Ralph Waldo Emerson and his son tried to get a calf into
                        the barn. But they made the common mistake of thinking only of what they wanted: Emerson pushed
                        and his son pulled. But the calf was doing just what they were doing; he was thinking only of
                        what he wanted; so he stiffened his legs and stubbornly refused to leave the pasture. The Irish
                        housemaid saw their predicament. She couldn™t write essays and books; but, on this occasion at
                        least, she had more horse sense, or calf sense, than Emerson had. She thought of what the calf
                        wanted; so she put her maternal finger in the calf™s mouth 48</p>
                    <p>and let the calf suck her finger as she gently led him into the barn.</p>
                    <p>
                        Every act you have ever performed since the day you were born was performed because you wanted
                        something. How about the time you gave a large contribution to the Red Cross? Yes, that is no
                        exception to the rule. You gave the Red Cross the donation because you wanted to lend a helping
                        hand; you wanted to do a beautiful, unselfish, divine act. " Inasmuch as ye have done it unto
                        one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        If you hadn™t wanted that feeling more than you wanted your money, you would not have made the
                        contribution. Of course, you might have made the contribution because you were ashamed to refuse
                        or because a customer asked you to do it. But one thing is certain. You made the contribution
                        because you wanted something.</p>

                        Harry A. Overstreet, in his illuminating book Influencing Human Behavior said; ﬁAction springs
                        out of what we fundamentally desire . .</p>
                    <p> and the best piece of advice which can be given to would-be persuaders, whether in business, in
                        the home, in the school, in politics, is: First, arouse in the other person an eager want. He
                        who can do this has the whole world with him. He who cannot walks a lonely way.ﬂ</p>

                        Andrew Carnegie, the poverty-stricken Scotch lad who started to work at two cents an hour and
                        finally gave away $365 million, learned early in life that the only way to influence people is
                        to talk in terms of what the other person wants. He attended school only four years; yet he
                        learned how to handle people.</p>
                    <p>
                        To illustrate: His sister-in-law was worried sick over her two boys. They were at Yale, and they
                        were so busy with their own affairs that they neglected to write home and paid no attention
                        whatever to their mother™s frantic letters.</p>
                    <p>
                        Then Carnegie offered to wager a hundred dollars that he could get an answer by return mail,
                        without even asking for it. Someone called his bet; so he wrote his nephews a chatty letter,
                        mentioning casually in a post-script that he was sending each one a five-dollar bill.</p>
                    <p>
                        He neglected, however, to enclose the money.</p>
                    <p>
                        Back came replies by return mail thanking ﬁDear Uncle Andrewﬂ for his kind noteŠand you can
                        finish the sentence yourself. 49</p>
                    <p>
                        Another example of persuading comes from Stan Novak of Cleveland, Ohio, a participant in our
                        course. Stan came home from work one evening to find his youngest son, Tim, kicking and
                        screaming on the living room floor. He was to start kindergarten the next day and was protesting
                        that he would not go. Stan™s normal reaction would have been to banish the child to his room and
                        tell him he™d just better mak up his mind to go. He had no choice. But tonight, recognizing that
                        this would not really help Tim start kindergarten in the best frame of mind, Stan sat down and
                        thought, ﬁIf I were Tim, why would I be excited about going to kindergarten?ﬂ He and his wife
                        made a list of al</p>
                    <p>the fun things Tim would do such as finger painting, singing songs, making new friends. Then they
                        put them into action. ﬁWe all started finger-painting on the kitchen tableŠmy wife, Lil, my
                        other son Bob, and myself, all having fun. Soon Tim was peeping around the corner. Next he was
                        begging to participate. ‚Oh, no! You have to go to kindergarten first to learn how to
                        finger-paint.™ With all the enthusiasm I could muster I went through the list talking in terms
                        he could understandŠtelling him all the fun he would have in kindergarten. The next morning, I
                        thought I wasthe first one up. I went downstairs and found Tim sitting sound asleep in the
                        living room chair. ‚What are you doing here?™ I asked. ‚I™m waiting to go to kindergarten. I
                        don™t want to be late.™ The enthusiasm of our entire family had aroused in Tim an eager want
                        that no amount of discussion or threat could have possibly accomplished.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        Tomorrow you may want to persuade somebody to do something. Before you speak, pause and ask
                        yourself: ﬁHow can I make this person want to do it?ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        That question will stop us from rushing into a situation heedlessly, with futile chatter about
                        our desires.</p>
                    <p>
                        At one time I rented the grand ballroom of a certain New York hotel for twenty nights in each
                        season in order to hold a series of lectures.</p>
                    <p>
                        At the beginning of one season, I was suddenly informed that I should have to pay almost three
                        times as much rent as formerly. This news reached me after the tickets had been printed and
                        distributed and all announcements had been made.</p>
                    <p>Naturally, I didn™t want to pay the increase, but what was the use of talking to the hotel about
                        what I wanted? They were interested only in what they wanted. So a couple of days later I went
                        to see the manager.</p>
                    <p>50</p>
                    <p>"I was a bit shocked when I got your letter,ﬂ I said, ﬁbut I don™t blame you at all. If I had
                        been in your position, I should probably have written a similar letter myself. Your duty as the
                        manager of the hotel is to make all the profit possible. If you don™t do that, you will be fired
                        and you ought to be fired. Now, let™s take a piece of paper and write down the advantages and
                        the disadvantages that will accrue to you, if you insist on this increase in rent.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        Then I took a letterhead and ran a line through the center and headed one column ﬁAdvantagesﬂ
                        and the other column ﬁDisadvantages.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        I wrote down under the head ﬁAdvantagesﬂ these words: ﬁBallroom free.ﬂ Then I went on to say:
                        ﬁYou will have the advantage of having the ballroom free to rent for dances and conventions.
                        That is a big advantage, for affairs like that will pay you much more than you can get for a
                        series of lectures. If I tie your ballroom up for twenty nights during the course of the season,
                        it is sure to mean a loss of some very profitable business to you.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁNow, let™s ‚consider the disadvantages. First, instead of increasing your income from me, you
                        are going to decrease it. In fact, you are going to wipe it out because I cannot pay the rent
                        you are asking. I shall be forced to hold these lectures at some other place.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁThere™s another disadvantage to you also. These lectures attract crowds of educated and
                        cultured people to your hotel. That is good advertising for you, isn™t it? In fact, if you spent
                        five thousand dollars advertising in the newspapers, you couldn™t bring as many people to look
                        at your hotel as I can bring by these lectures. That is worth a lot to a hotel, isn™t it?ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        As I talked, I wrote these two ﬁdisadvantagesﬂ under the proper heading, and handed the sheet of
                        paper to the manager, saying: "I wish you would carefully consider both the advantages and
                        disadvantages that are going to accrue to you and then give me your final decision.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        I received a letter the next day, informing me that my rent would be increased only 50 percent
                        instead of 300 percent.</p>
                    <p>
                        Mind you, I got this reduction without saying a word about what I wanted. I talked all the time
                        about what the other person wanted and how he could get it.</p>
                    <p>51</p>
                    <p>Suppose I had done the human, natural thing; suppose I had stormed into his office and said,
                        ﬁWhat do you mean by raising my rent three hundred percent when you know the tickets have been
                        printed and the announcements made? Three hundred percent! Ridiculous! Absurd! I won™t pay
                        it!ﬂ</p>
                    <p>What would have happened then? An argument would have begun to steam and boil and sputter - and
                        you know how arguments end. Even if I had convinced him that he was wrong, his pride would have
                        made it difficult for him to back down and give in.</p>
                    <p>
                        Here is one of the best bits of advice ever given about the fine art of human relationships. ﬁIf
                        there is any one secret of success,ﬂ said Henry Ford, ﬁit lies in the ability to get the other
                        person™s point of view and see things from that person™s angle as well as from your own.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        That is so good, I want to repeat it: "If there is any one secret of success, it lies in the
                        ability to get the other person's point of view and see things from that person™s angle as well
                        as from your own.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>That is so simple, so obvious, that anyone ought to see the truth of it at a glance; yet 90
                        percent of the people on this earth ignore it 90 percent of the time.</p>
                    <p>An example? Look at the letters that come across your desk tomorrow morning, and you will find
                        that most of them violate this important canon of common sense. Take this one, a letter written
                        by the head of the radio department of an advertising agency with offices scattered across the
                        continent. This letter was sent to the managers of local radio stations throughout the country.

                        After reading this letter, Mr. Vermylen, sales manager for A. Zerega™s Sons, Inc., sent it to me
                        with the following comment:</p>
                    <p>This letter had the reverse effect from that which was intended. The letter begins by describing
                        the Terminal™s difficulties, in which we are not interested, generally speaking. Our cooperation
                        is then requested without any thought as to whether it would inconvenience us, and then,
                        finally, in the last paragraph, the fact is mentioned that if we do cooperate it will mean more
                        expeditious discharge of our trucks with the assurance that our freight will go forward on the
                        date of its receipt.</p>
                    <p>In other words, that in which we are most interested is mentioned last and the whole effect is
                        one of raising a spirit of antagonism rather than of cooperation.</p>
                    <p>
                        Let™s see if we can™t rewrite and improve this letter. Let™s not waste any time talking about
                        our problems. As Henry Ford admonishes, let™s ﬁget the other person™s point of view and see
                        things from his or her angle, as well as from our own.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        Here is one way of revising the letter. It may not be the best way, but isn™t it an
                        improvement?</p>

                        Barbara Anderson, who worked in a bank in New York, desired to move to Phoenix, Arizona, because
                        of the health of her son. Using the principles she had learned in our course, she wrote the
                        following letter to twelve banks in Phoenix:</p>

                    <p>
                        Do you think Mrs. Anderson received any response from that letter? Eleven of the twelve banks
                        invited her to be interviewed, and she had a choice of which bank™s offer to accept. Why? Mrs.
                        Anderson did not state what she wanted, but wrote in the letter how she could help them, and
                        focused on their wants, not her own.</p>
                    <p>Thousands of salespeople are pounding the pavements today, tired, discouraged and underpaid. Why?
                        Because they are always thinking only of what they want. They don™t realize that neither you nor
                        I want to buy anything. If we did, we would go out and buy it. But both of us are eternally
                        interested in solving our problems. And if salespeople can show us how their services or
                        merchandise will help us solve our problems, they won™t need to sell us. We™ll buy. And
                        customers like to feel that they are buying - not being sold.</p>
                    <p>
                        Yet many salespeople spend a lifetime in selling without seeing things from the customer™s
                        angle. For example, for many years I lived in Forest Hills, a little community of private homes
                        in the center of Greater New York. One day as I was rushing to the station, I chanced to meet a
                        real-estate operator who had bought and sold property in that area for many years. He knew
                        Forest Hills well, so I hurriedly

                    <p>asked him whether or not my stucco house was built with metal lath or hollow tile. He said he
                        didn™t know and told me what I already knew - that I could find out by calling the Forest Hills
                        Garden Association. The following morning, I received a letter from him. Did he give me the
                        information I wanted? He could have gotten it in sixty seconds by a telephone call. But he
                        didn™t. He told me again that I could get it by telephoning, and then asked me to let him handle
                        my insurance.</p>
                    <p>
                        He was not interested in helping me. He was interested only in helping himself.</p>
                    <p>
                        J. Howard Lucas of Birmingham, Alabama, tells how two salespeople from the same company handled
                        the same type of situation, He reported:</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁSeveral years ago I was on the management team of a small company. Headquartered near us was
                        the district office of a large insurance company. Their agents were assigned territories, and
                        our company was assigned to two agents, whom I shall refer to as Carl and John.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁOne morning, Carl dropped by our office and casually mentioned that his company had just
                        introduced a new life insurance policy for executives and thought we might be interested later
                        on and he would get back to us when he had more information on it.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁThe same day, John saw us on the sidewalk while returning from a coffee break, and he shouted:
                        ‚Hey Luke, hold up, I have some great news for you fellows.™ He hurried over and very excitedly
                        told us about an executive life insurance policy his company had introduced that very day. (It
                        was the same policy that Carl had casually mentioned.) He wanted us to have one of the first
                        issued. He gave us a few important facts about the coverage and ended saying, ‚The policy is so
                        new, I™m going to have someone from the home office come out tomorrow and explain it. Now, in
                        the meantime, let™s get the applications signed and on the way so he can have more information
                        to work with.™ His enthusiasm aroused in us an eager want for this policy even though we still
                        did not have details, When they were made available to us, they confirmed John™s initial
                        understanding of the policy, and he not only sold each of us a policy, but later doubled our
                        coverage.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁCarl could have had those sales, but he made no effort to arouse in us any desire for the
                        policies.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>The world is full of people who are grabbing and self-seeking. So the rare 59</p>
                    <p>individual who unselfishly tries to serve others has an enormous advantage. He has little
                        competition. Owen D. Young, a noted lawyer and one of America™s great business leaders, once
                        said: ﬁPeople who can put themselves in the place of other people who can understand the
                        workings of their minds, need never worry about what the future has in store for them.ﬂ</p>

                        If out of reading this book you get just one thing - an increased tendency to think always in
                        terms of other people™s point of view, and see things from their angle - if you get that one
                        thing out of this book, it may easily prove to be one of the building blocks of your career.</p>
                    <p>
                        Looking at the other person™s point of view and arousing in them an eager want for something is
                        not to be construed as manipulating that person so that they will do something that is only for
                        your benefit and their detriment. Each party should gain from the negotiation. In the letters to
                        Mr. Vermylen, both the sender and the receiver of the correspondence gained by implementing what
                        was suggested. Both the bank and Mrs. Anderson won by her letter in that the bank obtained a
                        valuable employee and Mrs. Anderson a suitable job. And in the example of John™s sale of
                        insurance to Mr. Lucas, both gained through this transaction.</p>
                    <p>
                        Another example in which everybody gains through this principle of arousing an eager want comes
                        from Michael E. Whidden of Warwick, Rhode Island, who is a territory salesman for the Shell Oil
                        Company. Mike wanted to become the Number One salesperson in his district, but one service
                        station was holding him back. It was run by an older man who could not be motivated to clean up
                        his station. It was in such poor shape that sales were declining significantly.</p>
                    <p>
                        This manager would not listen to any of Mike™s pleas to upgrade the station. After many
                        exhortations and heart-to-heart talksŠall of which had no impactŠMike decided to invite the
                        manager to visit the newest Shell station in his territory.</p>
                    <p>
                        The manager was so impressed by the facilities at the new station that when Mike visited him the
                        next time, his station was cleaned up and had recorded a sales increase. This enabled Mike to
                        reach the Number One spot in his district. All his talking and discussion hadn™t helped, but by
                        arousing an eager want in the manager, by showing him the modern station, he had accomplished
                        his goal, and both the manager and Mike benefited.</p>
                    <p>Most people go through college and learn to read Virgil and master the mysteries of 60</p>
                    <p>calculus without ever discovering how their own minds function. For instance: I once gave a
                        course in Effective Speaking for the young college graduates who were entering the employ of the
                        Carrier Corporation, the large air-conditioner manufacturer. One of the participants wanted to
                        persuade the others to play basketball in their free time, and this is about what he said: "I
                        want you to come out and play basketball. I like to play basketball, but the last few times I™ve
                        been to the gymnasium there haven™t been enough people to get up a game. Two or three of us got
                        to throwing the ball around the other night - and I got a black eye. I wish all of you would
                        come down tomorrow night. I want to play basketball.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        Did he talk about anything you want? You don™t want to go to a gymnasium that no one else goes
                        to, do you? You don™t care about what he wants. You don™t want to get a black eye.</p>
                    <p>
                        Could he have shown you how to get the things you want by using the gymnasium? Surely. More pep.
                        Keener edge to the appetite. Clearer brain. Fun. Games. Basketball.</p>
                    <p>
                        To repeat Professor Overstreet™s wise advice: First, arouse in the other person an eager want.
                        He who can do this has the whole world with him. He who cannot walks a lonely way.</p>
                    <p>
                        One of the students in the author™s training course was worried about his little boy. The child
                        was underweight and refused to eat properly. His parents used the usual method. They scolded and
                        nagged. ﬁMother wants you to eat this and that.ﬂ "Father wants you to grow up to be a big
                        man.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        Did the boy pay any attention to these pleas? Just about as much as you pay to one fleck of sand
                        on a sandy beach.</p>
                    <p>No one with a trace of horse sense would expect a child three years old to react to the viewpoint
                        of a father thirty years old. Yet that was precisely what that father had expected. It was
                        absurd. He finally saw that. So he said to himself: ﬁWhat does that boy want? How can I tie up
                        what I want to what he wants?ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        It was easy for the father when he starting thinking about it. His boy had a tricycle that he
                        loved to ride up and down the sidewalk in front of the house in Brooklyn. A few doors down the
                        street lived a bullyŠa bigger boy who would pull the little boy off his tricycle and ride it
                        himself. 61</p>
                    <p> Naturally, the little boy would run screaming to his mother, and she would have to come out and
                        take the bully off the tricycle and put her little boy on again, This happened almost every
                        day.</p>
                    <p>
                        What did the little boy want? It didn™t take a Sherlock Holmes to answer that one. His pride,
                        his anger, his desire for a feeling of importanceŠall the strongest emotions in his
                        makeupŠgoaded him to get revenge, to smash the bully in the nose. And when his father explained
                        that the boy would be able to wallop the daylights out of the bigger kid someday if he would
                        only eat the things his mother wanted him to eatŠwhen his father promised him thatŠthere was no
                        longer any problem of dietetics. That boy would have eaten spinach, sauerkraut, salt
                        mackerelŠanything in order to be big enough to whip the bully who had humiliated him so
                        often.</p>
                    <p>After solving that problem, the parents tackled another: the little boy had the unholy habit of
                        wetting his bed.</p>
                    <p>He slept with his grandmother. In the morning, his grandmother would wake up and feel the sheet
                        and say: ﬁLook, Johnny, what you did again last night.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        He would say: ﬁNo, I didn™t do it. You did it.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        Scolding, spanking, shaming him, reiterating that the parents didn™t want him to do itŠnone of
                        these things kept the bed dry. So the parents asked: ﬁHow can we make this boy want to stop
                        wetting his bed?ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        What were his wants? First, he wanted to wear pajamas like Daddy instead of wearing a nightgown
                        like Grandmother. Grandmother was getting fed up with his nocturnal iniquities, so she gladly
                        offered to buy him a pair of pajamas if he would reform. Second, he wanted a bed of his own.
                        Grandma didn™t object.</p>
                    <p>
                        His mother took him to a department store in Brooklyn, winked at the salesgirl, and said: ﬁHere
                        is a little gentleman who would like to do some shopping.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        The salesgirl made him feel important by saying: ﬁYoung man, what can I show you?ﬂ</p>
                    <p>He stood a couple of inches taller and said: ﬁI want to buy a bed for myself.ﬂ 62</p>
                    <p>
                        When he was shown the one his mother wanted him to buy, she winked at the salesgirl and the boy
                        was persuaded to buy it.</p>
                    <p>
                        The bed was delivered the next day; and that night, when Father came home, the little boy ran to
                        the door shouting: ﬁDaddy! Daddy! Come upstairs and see my bed that I bought!ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        The father, looking at the bed, obeyed Charles Schwab™s injunction: he was ﬁhearty in his
                        approbation and lavish in his praise.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁYou are not going to wet this bed, are you?ﬂ the father said. " Oh, no, no! I am not going to
                        wet this bed.ﬂ The boy kept his promise, for his pride was involved. That was his bed. He and he
                        alone had bought it. And he was wearing pajamas now like a little man. He wanted to act like a
                        man. And he did.</p>
                    <p>
                        Another father, K. T. Dutschmann, a telephone engineer, a student of this course, couldn™t get
                        his three-year old daughter to eat breakfast food. The usual scolding, pleading, coaxing methods
                        had all ended in futility. So the parents asked themselves: ﬁHow can we make her want to do
                        it?ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        The little girl loved to imitate her mother, to feel big and grown up; so one morning they put
                        her on a chair and let her make the breakfast food. At just the psychological moment, Father
                        drifted into the kitchen while she was stirring the cereal and she said: ﬁOh, look, Daddy, I am
                        making the cereal this morning.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        She ate two helpings of the cereal without any coaxing, because she was interested in it. She
                        had achieved a feeling of importance; she had found in making the cereal an avenue of
                        self-expression.</p>
                    <p>
                        William Winter once remarked that "self-expression is the dominant necessity of human nature.ﬂ
                        Why can™t we adapt this same psychology to business dealings? When we have a brilliant idea,
                        instead of making others think it is ours, why not let them cook and stir the idea themselves.
                        They will then regard it as their own; they will like it and maybe eat a couple of helpings of
                        it.</p>
                    <p>
                        Remember: ﬁFirst, arouse in the other person an eager want. He who can do this has the whole
                        world with him. He who cannot walks a lonely way."</p>
