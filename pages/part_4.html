                    <h3>Be a Leader: How to Change People Without Giving Offense or Arousing Resentment</h3>
                    <p>
                        1 - IF YOU MUST FIND FAULT, THIS IS THE WAY TO BEGIN</p>
                    <p>
                        A friend of mine was a guest at the White House for a weekend during the administration of
                        Calvin Coolidge. Drifting into the President™s private office, he heard Coolidge say to one of
                        his secretaries, ﬁThat™s a pretty dress you are wearing this morning, and you are a very
                        attractive young woman.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        That was probably the most effusive praise Silent Cal had ever bestowed upon a secretary in his
                        life. It was so unusual, so unexpected, that the secretary blushed in confusion. Then Coolidge
                        said, ﬁNow, don™t get stuck up. I just said that to make you feel good. From now on, I wish you
                        would be a little bit more careful with your Punctuation.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>His method was probably a bit obvious, but the psychology was superb. It is always easier to
                        listen to unpleasant things after we have heard some praise of our good points.</p>
                    <p>
                        A barber lathers a man before he shaves him; and that is precisely what McKinley did back in
                        1896, when he was running for President. One of the prominent Republicans of that day had
                        written a campaign speech that he felt was just a trifle better than Cicero and Patrick Henry
                        and Daniel Webster all rolled into one. With great glee, this chap read his immortal speech
                        aloud to McKinley. The speech had its fine points, but it just wouldn™t do. It would have raised
                        a tornado of criticism. McKinley didn™t want to hurt the man™s feelings. He must not kill the
                        man™s splendid enthusiasm, and yet he had to say "no." Note how adroitly he did it.</p>
                    <p>
                        "My friend, that is a splendid speech, a magnificent speech,ﬂ McKinley said. ﬁNo one could have
                        prepared a better one. There are many occasions on which it would be precisely the right thing
                        to say, but is it quite suitable to this particular occasion? Sound and sober as it is from your
                        standpoint, I must consider its effect from the party™s standpoint. Now you go home and write a
                        speech along the lines I indicate, and send me a copy of it.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>179</p>
                    <p>He did just that. McKinley blue-penciled and helped him rewrite his second speech, and he became
                        one of the effective speakers of the campaign.</p>
                    <p>
                        Here is the second most famous letter that Abraham Lincoln ever wrote. (His most famous one was
                        written to Mrs. Bixby, expressing his sorrow for the death of the five sons she had lost in
                        battle.) Lincoln probably dashed this letter off in five minutes; yet it sold at public auction
                        in 1926 for twelve thousand dollars, and that, by the way, was more money than Lincoln was able
                        to save during half a century of hard work. The letter was written to General Joseph Hooker on
                        April 26, 1863, during the darkest period of the Civil War. For eighteen months, Lincoln™s
                        generals had been leading the Union Army from one tragic defeat to another. Nothing but futile,
                        stupid human butchery. The nation was appalled. Thousands of soldiers had deserted from the
                        army, and even the Republican members of the Senate had revolted and wanted to force Lincoln out
                        of the White House. ﬁWe are now on the brink of destruction,ﬂ Lincoln said. It appears to me
                        that even the Almighty is against us. I can hardly see a ray of hope.ﬂ Such was the black sorrow
                        and chaos out of which this letter came.</p>
                    <p>
                        I am printing the letter here because it shows how Lincoln tried to change an obstreperous
                        general when the very fate of the nation could have depended upon the general™s action.</p>
                    <p>
                        This is perhaps the sharpest letter Abe Lincoln wrote after he became President; yet you will
                        note that he praised General Hooker before he spoke of his grave faults.</p>
                    <p>
                        Yes, they were grave faults, but Lincoln didn™t call them that. Lincoln was more conservative,
                        more diplomatic. Lincoln wrote: ﬁThere are some things in regard to which I am not quite
                        satisfied with you.ﬂ Talk about tact! And diplomacy!</p>
                    <p>
                        Here is the letter addressed to General Hooker:</p>
                    <p>
                        I have placed you at the head of the Army of the Potomac. Of course, I have done this upon what
                        appears to me to be sufficient reasons, and yet I think it best for you to know that there are
                        some things in regard to which I am not quite satisfied with you.</p>
                    <p>
                        I believe you to be a brave and skillful soldier, which, of course, I like. I also believe you
                        do not mix politics with your profession, in which you are right. You 180</p>
                    <p>have confidence in yourself, which is a valuable if not an indispensable quality.</p>
                    <p>
                        You are ambitious, which, within reasonable bounds, does good rather than harm, But I think that
                        during General Burnside™s command of the army you have taken counsel of your ambition and
                        thwarted him as much as you could, in which you did a great wrong to the country and to a most
                        meritorious and honorable brother officer.</p>
                    <p>
                        I have heard, in such a way as to believe it, of your recently saying that both the army and the
                        Government needed a dictator. Of course, it was not for this, but in spite of it, that I have
                        given you command.</p>
                    <p>
                        Only those generals who gain successes can set up as dictators. What I now ask of you is
                        military success and I will risk the dictatorship.</p>
                    <p>
                        The Government will support you to the utmost of its ability, which is neither more nor less
                        than it has done and will do for all commanders. I much fear that the spirit which you have
                        aided to infuse into the army, of criticizing their commander and withholding confidence from
                        him, will now turn upon you. I shall assist you, as far as I can, to put it down.</p>
                    <p>Neither you nor Napoleon, if he were alive again, could get any good out of an army while such
                        spirit prevails in it, and now beware of rashness. Beware of rashness, but with energy and
                        sleepless vigilance go forward and give us victories.</p>
                    <p>
                        You are not a Coolidge, a McKinley or a Lincoln. You want to know whether this philosophy will
                        operate for you in everyday business contacts. Will it? Let™s see. Let™s take the case of W. P.
                        Gaw of the Wark Company, Philadelphia.</p>
                    <p>
                        The Wark Company had contracted to build and complete a large office building in Philadelphia by
                        a certain specified date. Everything was going along well; the building was almost finished,
                        when suddenly the sub-contractor making the ornamental bronze work to go on the exterior of this
                        building declared that he couldn™t make delivery on schedule. What! An entire building held up!
                        Heavy penalties! Distressing losses! All because of one man!</p>
                    <p>
                        Long-distance telephone calls. Arguments! Heated conversations! All in vain. Then Mr. Gaw was
                        sent to New York to beard the bronze lion in his den.</p>
                    <p>181</p>
                    <p>ﬁDo you know you are the only person in Brooklyn with your name,?" Mr Gaw asked the president of
                        the subcontracting firm shortly after they were introduced. The president was surprised. ﬁNo, I
                        didn™t know that.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁWell,ﬂ said Mr. Gaw, ﬁwhen I got off the train this morning, I looked in the telephone book to
                        get your address, and you™re the only person in the Brooklyn phone book with your name.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁI never knew that,ﬂ the subcontractor said. He checked the phone book with interest. ﬁWell,
                        it™s an unusual name,ﬂ he said proudly. "My family came from Holland and settled in New York
                        almost two hundred years ago. " He continued to talk about his family and his ancestors for
                        several minutes. When he finished that, Mr. Gaw complimented him on how large a plant he had and
                        compared it favorably with a number of similar plants he had visited. ﬁIt is one of the cleanest
                        and neatest bronze factories I ever saw,ﬂ said Gaw.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁI™ve spent a lifetime building up this business,ﬂ the subcontractor said, ﬁand I am rather
                        proud of it. Would you like to take a look around the factory?ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        During this tour of inspection, Mr. Gaw complimented the other man on his system of fabrication
                        and told him how and why it seemed superior to those of some of his competitors. Gaw commented
                        on some unusual machines, and the subcontractor announced that he himself had invented those
                        machines. He spent considerable time showing Gaw how they operated and the superior work they
                        turned out. He insisted on taking his visitor to lunch. So far, mind you, not a word had been
                        said about the real purpose of Gaw™s visit.</p>
                    <p>
                        After lunch, the subcontractor said, ﬁNow, to get down to business. Naturally, I know why you™re
                        here. I didn™t expect that our meeting would be so enjoyable. You can go back to Philadelphia
                        with my promise that your material will be fabricated and shipped, even if other orders have to
                        be delayed.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        Mr. Gaw got everything that he wanted without even asking for it. The material arrived on time,
                        and the building was completed on the day the completion contract specified.</p>
                    <p>
                        Would this have happened had Mr. Gaw used the hammer-and-dynamite method generally employed on
                        such occasions?</p>
                    <p>182</p>
                    <p>Dorothy Wrublewski, a branch manager of the Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, Federal Credit Union,
                        reported to one of our classes how she was able to help one of her employees become more
                        productive.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁWe recently hired a young lady as a teller trainee. Her contact with our customers was very
                        good. She was accurate and efficient in handling individual transactions. The problem developed
                        at the end of the day when it was time to balance out.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁThe head teller came to me and strongly suggested that I fire this woman. ‚She is holding up
                        everyone else because she is so slow in balancing out. I™ve shown her over and over, but she
                        can™t get it. She™s got to go.™</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁThe next day I observed her working quickly and accurately when handling the normal everyday
                        transactions, and she was very pleasant with our customers.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁIt didn™t take long to discover why she had trouble balancing out. After the office closed, I
                        went over to talk with her. She was obviously nervous and upset. I praised her for being so
                        friendly and outgoing with the customers and complimented her for the accuracy and speed used in
                        that work. I then suggested we review the procedure we use in balancing the cash drawer. Once
                        she realized I had confidence in her, she easily followed my suggestions and soon mastered this
                        function. We have had no problems with her since then.ﬂ</p>

                    <p>Charles Schwab was passing through one of his steel mills one day at noon when he came across
                        some of his employees smoking. Immediately above their heads was a sign that said ﬁNo Smoking.ﬂ
                        Did Schwab point to the sign and say, ﬁCan™t you read.? Oh, no not Schwab. He walked over to the
                        men, handed each one a cigar, and said, ﬁI™ll appreciate it, boys, if you will smoke these on
                        the outside.ﬂ They knew that he knew that they had broken a rule - and they admired him because
                        he said nothing about it and gave them a little present and made them feel important. Couldn™t
                        keep from loving a man like that, could you?</p>
                    <p>
                        John Wanamaker used the same technique. Wanamaker used to make a tour of his great store in
                        Philadelphia every day. Once he saw a customer waiting at a counter. No one was paying the
                        slightest attention to her. The salespeople? Oh, they were in a huddle at the far end of the
                        counter laughing and talking among themselves. Wanamaker didn™t say a word. Quietly slipping
                        behind the counter, he waited on the woman himself and then handed the purchase to the
                        salespeople to be wrapped as he went on his way.</p>

                        Public officials are often criticized for not being accessible to their constituents. They are
                        busy people, and the fault sometimes lies in overprotective assistants who don™t want to
                        overburden their bosses with too many visitors. Carl Langford, who has been mayor of
                        Orlando,</p>
                    <p>Florida, the home of Disney World, for many years, frequently admonished his staff to allow
                        people to see him. clamed he had an ﬁopen-doorﬂ policy; yet the citizens of his community were
                        blocked by secretaries and administrators when they called.</p>
                    <p>
                        Finally the mayor found the solution. He removed the door from his office! His aides got the
                        message, and the mayor has had a truly open administration since the day his door was
                        symbolically thrown away.</p>
                    <p>
                        Simply changing one three-letter word can often spell the difference between failure and success
                        in changing people without giving offense or arousing resentment.</p>
                    <p>
                        Many people begin their criticism with sincere praise followed by the word ﬁbutﬂ and ending with
                        a critical statement. For example, in trying to change a child™s careless attitude toward
                        studies, we might say, ﬁWe™re really proud of you, Johnnie, 184</p>
                    <p>for raising your grades this term. But if you had worked harder on your algebra, the results
                        would have been better.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        In this case, Johnnie might feel encouraged until he heard the word ﬁbut.ﬂ He might then
                        question the sincerity of the original praise. To him, the praise seemed only to be a contrived
                        lead-in to a critical inference of failure. Credibility would be strained, and we probably would
                        not achieve our objectives of changing Johnnie™s attitude toward his studies.</p>
                    <p>
                        This could be easily overcome by changing the word "but" to "and." ﬁWe™re really proud of you,
                        Johnnie, for raising your grades this term, and by continuing the same conscientious efforts
                        next term, your algebra grade can be up with all the others.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>Now, Johnnie would accept the praise because there was no follow-up of an inference of failure.
                        We have called his attention to the behavior we wished to change indirectly and the chances are
                        he will try to live up to our expectations.</p>
                    <p>
                        Calling attention to one™s mistakes indirectly works wonders with sensitive people who may
                        resent bitterly any direct criticism. Marge Jacob of Woonsocket, Rhode Island, told one of our
                        classes how she convinced some sloppy construction workers to clean up after themselves when
                        they were building additions to her house.</p>
                    <p>
                        For the first few days of the work, when Mrs. Jacob returned from her job, she noticed that the
                        yard was strewn with the cut ends of lumber. She didn™t want to antagonize the builders, because
                        they did excellent work. So after the workers had gone home, she and her children picked up and
                        neatly piled all the lumber debris in a corner. The following morning she called the foreman to
                        one side and said, ﬁI™m really pleased with the way the front lawn was left last night; it is
                        nice and clean and does not offend the neighbors.ﬂ From that day forward the workers picked up
                        and piled the debris to one side, and the foreman came in each day seeking approval of the
                        condition the lawn was left in after a day™s work.</p>

                        One of the major areas of controversy between members of the army reserves and their regular
                        army trainers is haircuts. The reservists consider themselves civilians (which they are most of
                        the time) and resent having to cut their hair short.</p>
                    <p>
                        Master Sergeant Harley Kaiser of the 542nd USAR School addressed himself to this problem when he
                        was working with a group of reserve noncommissioned 185</p>
                    <p>officers. As an old-time regular-army master sergeant, he might have been expected to yell at his
                        troops and threaten them. Instead he chose to make his point indirectly.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁGentlemen,ﬂ he started, ﬁyou are leaders. You will be most effective when you lead by example.
                        You must be the example for your men to follow. You know what the army regulations say about
                        haircuts. I am going to get my hair cut today, although it is still much shorter than some of
                        yours. You look at yourself in the mirror, and if you feel you need a haircut to be a good
                        example, we'll arrange time for you to visit the post barbership.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        The result was predictable. Several of the candidates did look in the mirror and went to the
                        barbershop that afternoon and received ﬁregulationﬂ haircuts. Sergeant Kaiser commented the next
                        morning that he already could see the development of leadership qualities in some of the members
                        of the squad.</p>
                    <p>
                        On March 8, 1887, the eloquent Henry Ward Beecher died. The following Sunday, Lyman Abbott was
                        invited to speak in the pulpit left silent by Beecher™s passing. Eager to do his best, he wrote,
                        rewrote and polished his sermon with the meticulous care of a Flaubert. Then he read it to his
                        wife. It was poor - as most written speeches are. She might have said, if she had had less
                        judgment, ﬁLyman, that is terrible. That™ll never do. You™ll put people to sleep. It reads like
                        an encyclopedia. You ought to know better than that after all the years you have been preaching.
                        For heaven™s sake, why don™t you talk like a human being? Why don™t you act natural? You™ll
                        disgrace yourself if you ever read that stuff.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        That™s what she might have said. And, if she had, you know what would have happened. And she
                        knew too. So, she merely remarked that it would make an excellent article for the North American
                        Review. In other words, she praised it and at the same time subtly suggested that it wouldn™t do
                        as a speech. Lyman Abbott saw the point, tore up his carefully prepared manuscript and preached
                        without even using notes.</p>

                        3 - TALK ABOUT YOUR OWN MISTAKES FIRST</p>
                    <p>
                        My niece, Josephine Carnegie, had come to New York to be my secretary. She was nineteen, had
                        graduated from high school three years previously, and her business experience was a trifle more
                        than zero. She became one of the most proficient secretaries west of Suez, but in the beginning,
                        she was - well, susceptible to improvement. One day when I started to criticize her, I said to
                        myself: ﬁJust a minute, Dale Carnegie; just a minute. You are twice as old as Josephine. You
                        have had ten thousand times as much business experience. How can you possibly expect her to have
                        your viewpoint, your judgment, your initiative - mediocre though they may be? And just a minute,
                        Dale, what were you doing at nineteen? Remember the asinine mistakes and blunders you made?
                        Remember the time you did this . . . and that . . . ?"</p>
                    <p>
                        After thinking the matter over, honestly and impartially, I concluded that Josephine™s batting
                        average at nineteen was better than mine had been - and that, I™m sorry to confess, isn™t paying
                        Josephine much of a compliment.</p>
                    <p>
                        So after that, when I wanted to call Josephine™s attention to a mistake, I used to begin by
                        saying, ﬁYou have made a mistake, Josephine, but the Lord knows, it™s no worse than many I have
                        made. You were not born with judgment. That comes only with experience, and you are better than
                        I was at your age. I have been guilty of so many stupid, silly things myself, I have very little
                        incliion to criticize you or anyone. But don™t you think it would have been wiser if you had
                        done so and so?"</p>
                    <p>
                        It isn™t nearly so difficult to listen to a recital of your faults if the person criticizing
                        begins by humbly admitting that he, too, is far from impeccable.</p>
                    <p>
                        E. G. Dillistone, an engineer in Brandon, Manitoba, Canada, was having problems with his new
                        secretary. Letters he dictated were coming to his desk for signature with two or three spelling
                        mistakes per page. Mr. Dillistone reported how he handled this:</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁLike many engineers, I have not been noted for my excellent English or spelling. For years I
                        have kept a little black thumb - index book for words I had trouble spelling. When it became
                        apparent that merely pointing out the errors was not going to cause my secretary to do more
                        proofreading and dictionary work, I resolved to take another approach. When the next letter came
                        to my attention that had errors in 187</p>
                    <p>it, I sat down with the typist and said:</p>
                    <p>
                        " 'Somehow this word doesn™t look right. It™s one of the words I always have had trouble with.
                        That™s the reason I started this spelling book of mine. [I opened the book to the appropriate
                        page.] Yes, here it is. I™m very conscious of my spelling now because people do judge us by our
                        letters and misspellings make us look less professional.'</p>
                    <p>"I don't know whether she copied my system or not, but since that conversation, her frequency of
                        spelling errors has been significantly reduced.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        The polished Prince Bernhard von Bülow learned the sharp necessity of doing this back in 1909.
                        Von Bülow was then the Imperial Chancellor of Germany, and on the throne sat</p>
                    <p>Wilhelm II-Wilhelm, the haughty; Wilhelm the arrogant; Wilhelm, the last of the German Kaisers,
                        building an army and navy that he boasted could whip their weight in wildcats</p>
                    <p>
                        Then an astonishing thing happened. The Kaiser said things, incredible things, things that
                        rocked the continent and started a series of explosions heard around the world. To make matters
                        infinitely worse, the Kaiser made silly, egotistical, absurd announcements in public, he made
                        them while he was a guest in England, and he gave his royal permission to have them printed in
                        the Daily Telegraph. For example, he declared that he was the only German who felt friendly
                        toward the English; that he was constructing a navy against the menace of Japan; that he, and he
                        alone, had saved England from being humbled in the dust by Russia and France; that it had been
                        his campaign plan that enabled England™s Lord Roberts to defeat the Boers in South Africa; and
                        so on and on.</p>
                    <p>No other such amazing words had ever fallen from the lips of a European king in peacetime within
                        a hundred years. The entire continent buzzed with the fury of a hornet™s nest. England was
                        incensed. German statesmen were aghast. And in the midst of all this consternation, the Kaiser
                        became panicky and suggested to Prince von Bülow, the Imperial Chancellor, that he take the
                        blame. Yes, he wanted von Bülow to announce that it was all his responsibility, that he had
                        advised his monarch to say these incredible things.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁBut Your Majesty,ﬂ von Bülow protested, ﬁit seems to me utterly impossible that anybody either
                        in Germany or England could suppose me capable of having advised Your Majesty to say any such
                        thing.ﬂ 188</p>
                    <p>
                        The moment those words were out of von Bülow's mouth, he realized he had made a grave mistake.
                        The Kaiser blew up.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁYou consider me a donkey,ﬂ he shouted, ﬁcapable of blunders you yourself could never have
                        committed!ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        Von Bülow's knew that he ought to have praised before he condemned; but since that was too late,
                        he did the next best thing. He praised after he had criticized. And it worked a miracle.</p>
                    <p>
                        "I'm far from suggesting that,ﬂ he answered respectfully. ﬁYour Majesty surpasses me in manv
                        respects; not only of course, in naval and military knowledge but above all, in natural science.
                        I have often listened in admiration when Your Majesty explained the barometer, or wireless
                        telegraphy, or the Roentgen rays. I am shamefully ignorant of all branches of natural science,
                        have no notion of chemistry or physics, and am quite incapable of explaining the simplest of
                        natural phenomena. But,ﬂ von Büllow continued, ﬁin compensation, I possess some historical
                        knowledge and perhaps certain qualities useful in politics, especially in diplomacy.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        The Kaiser beamed. Von Bulow had praised him. Von Bülow had exalted him and humbled himself. The
                        Kaiser could forgive anything after that. ﬁHaven™t I always told you," he exclaimed with
                        enthusiasm, ﬁthat we complete one another famously? We should stick together, and we will!"</p>
                    <p>
                        He shook hands with von Bülow, not once, but several times. And later in the day he waxed so
                        enthusiastic that he exclaimed with doubled fists, ﬁIf anyone says anything to me against Prince
                        von Bülow, I shall punch him in the nose.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        Von Bülow saved himself in time - but, canny diplomat that he was, he nevertheless had made one
                        error: he should have begun by talking about his own shortcomings and Wilhelm™s superiority -
                        not by intimating that the Kaiser was a half-wit in need of a guardian.</p>
                    <p>If a few sentences humbling oneself and praising the other party can turn a haughty, insulted
                        Kaiser into a staunch friend, imagine what humility and praise can do for you and me in our
                        daily contacts. Rightfully used, they will work veritable miracles in human relations.</p>
                    <p>189</p>
                    <p>Admitting one™s own mistakesŠeven when one hasn™t corrected themŠcan help convince somebody to
                        change his behavior. This was illustrated more recently by Clarence Zerhusen of Timonium,
                        Maryland, when he discovered his fifteen-year-old son was experimenting with cigarettes.</p>

                        ﬁNaturally, I didn™t want David to smoke,ﬂ Mr. Zerhusen told us, ﬁbut his mother and I smoked
                        cigarettes; we were giving him a bad example all the time. I explained to Dave how I started
                        smoking at about his age and how the nicotine had gotten the best of me and now it was nearly
                        impossible for me to stop. I reminded him how irritating my cough was and how he had been after
                        me to give up cigarettes not many years before.</p>
                    <p>
                        "I didn™t exhort him to stop or make threats or warn him about their dangers. All I did was
                        point out how I was hooked on cigarettes and what it had meant to me.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁHe thought about it for a while and decided he wouldn™t smoke until he had graduated from high
                        school. As the years went by David never did start smoking and has no intention of ever doing
                        so.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁAs a result of that conversation I made the decision to stop smoking cigarettes myself, and
                        with the support of my family, I have succeeded.ﬂ</p>

                        4 - NO ONE LIKES TO TAKE ORDERS</p>
                    <p>
                        I once had the pleasure of dining with Miss Ida Tarbell, the dean of American biographers. When
                        I told her I was writing this book, we began discussing this all-important subject of getting
                        along with people, and she told me that while she was writing her biography of Owen D. Young,
                        she interviewed a man who had sat for three years in the same office with Mr. Young. This man
                        declared that during all that time he had never heard Owen D. Young give a direct order to
                        anyone. He always gave suggestions, not orders. Owen D. Young never said, for example, ﬁDo this
                        or do that,ﬂ or ﬁDon™t do this or don™t do that.ﬂ He would say, ﬁYou might consider this,ﬂ or
                        ﬁDo you think that would work?ﬂ Frequently he would say, after he had dictated a letter, ﬁWhat
                        do you think of this?ﬂ In looking over a letter of one of his assistants, he would say, ﬁMaybe
                        if we were to phrase it this way it would be better.ﬂ He always gave people the opportunity to
                        do things themselves; he never told his assistants to do things; he let them do them, let them
                        learn from their mistakes.</p>
                    <p>
                        A technique like that makes it easy for a person to correct errors. A technique like that saves
                        a person™s pride and gives him or her a feeling of importance. It encourages cooperation instead
                        of rebellion.</p>
                    <p>
                        Resentment caused by a brash order may last a long time - even if the order was given to correct
                        an obviously bad situation. Dan Santarelli, a teacher at a vocational school in Wyoming,
                        Pennsylvania, told one of our classes how one of his students had blocked the entrance way to
                        one of the school™s shops by illegally parking his car in it. One of the other instructors
                        stormed into the classroom and asked in an arrogant tone, ﬁWhose car is blocking the driveway?"
                        When the student who owned the car responded, the instructor screamed: ﬁMove that car and move
                        it right now, or I™ll wrap a chain around it and drag it out of there.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>Now that student was wrong. The car should not have been parked there. But from that day on, not
                        only did that student resent the instructor™s action, but all the students in the class did
                        everything they could to give the instructor a hard time and make his job unpleasant.</p>
                    <p>
                        How could he have handled it differently? If he had asked in a friendly way, ﬁWhose car is in
                        the driveway?ﬂ and then suggested that if it were moved, other cars could get in and out, the
                        student would have gladly moved it and neither he nor 191</p>
                    <p>his classmates would have been upset and resentful.</p>
                    <p>
                        Asking questions not only makes an order more palatable; it often stimulates the creativity of
                        the persons whom you ask. People are more likely to accept an order if they have had a part in
                        the decision that caused the order to be issued.</p>
                    <p>
                        When Ian Macdonald of Johannesburg, South Africa, the general manager of a small manufacturing
                        plant specializing in precision machine parts, had the opportunity to accept a very large order,
                        he was convinced that he would not meet the promised delivery date. The work already scheduled
                        in the shop and the short completion time needed for this order made it seem impossible for him
                        to accept the order.</p>
                    <p>Instead of pushing his people to accelerate their work and rush the order through, he called
                        everybody together, explained the situation to them, and told them how much it would mean to the
                        company and to them if they could make it possible to produce the order on time.</p>
                    <p>
                        Then he started asking questions:</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁIs there anything we can do to handle this order?ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁCan anyone think of different ways to process it through the shop that will make it possible to
                        take the order?ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁIs there any way to adjust our hours or personnel assignments that would help?ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        The employees came up with many ideas and insisted that he take the order. They approached it
                        with a ﬁWe can do itﬂ attitude, and the order was accepted, produced and delivered on time.</p>

                        5 - LET THE OTHER PERSON SAVE FACE</p>
                    <p>
                        Years ago the General Electric Company was faced with the delicate task of removing Charles
                        Steinmetz from the head of a department. Steinmetz, a genius of the first magnitude when it came
                        to electricity, was a failure as the head of the calculating department. Yet the company didn™t
                        dare offend the man. He was indispensable - and highly sensitive. So they gave him a new title.
                        They made him Consulting Engineer of the General Electric CompanyŠa new title for work he was
                        already doingŠand let someone else head up the department.</p>
                    <p>
                        Steinmetz was happy.</p>
                    <p>So were the officers of G.E. They had gently maneuvered their most temperamental star, and they
                        had done it without a storm - by letting him save face.</p>
                    <p>
                        Letting one save face! How important, how vitally important that is! And how few of us ever stop
                        to think of it! We ride roughshod over the feelings of others, getting our own way, finding
                        fault, issuing threats, criticizing a child or an employee in front of others, without even
                        considering the hurt to the other person™s pride. Whereas a few minutes™ thought, a considerate
                        word or two, a genuine understanding of the other person™s attitude, would go so far toward
                        alleviating the sting!</p>
                    <p>
                        Let™s remember that the next time we are faced with the distasteful necessity of discharging or
                        reprimanding an employee.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁFiring employees is not much fun. Getting fired is even less fun.ﬂ (I™m quoting now from a
                        letter written me by Marshall A. Granger, a certified public accountant.) ﬁOur business is
                        mostly seasonal. Therefore we have to let a lot of people go after the income tax rush is
                        over.</p>
                    <p>
                        It™s a byword in our profession that no one enjoys wielding the ax. Consequently, the custom has
                        developed of getting it over as soon as possible, and usually in the following way: ‚Sit down,
                        Mr. Smith. The season™s over, and we don™t seem to see any more assignments for you. Of course,
                        you understood you were only employed for the busy season anyhow, etc., etc.™</p>
                    <p>ﬁThe effect on these people is one of disappointment and a feeling of being ‚let 193</p>
                    <p>down.™ Most of them are in the accounting field for life, and they retain no particular love for
                        the firm that drops them so casually.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁI recently decided to let our seasonal personnel go with a little more tact and consideration.
                        So I call each one in only after carefully thinking over his or her work during the winter. And
                        I™ve said something like this: ‚Mr. Smith, you™ve done a fine job (if he has). That time we sent
                        you to Newark, you had a tough assignment. You were on the spot, but you came through with
                        flying colors, and we want you to know the firm is proud of you. You™ve got the stuff - you™re
                        going a long way, wherever you™re working. This firm believes in you, and is rooting for you,
                        and we don™t want you to forget it.™</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁEffect? The people go away feeling a lot better about being fired. They don™t feel ‚let down.™
                        They know if we had work for them, we™d keep them on. And when we need them again, they come to
                        us with a keen personal affection.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        At one session of our course, two class members discussed the negative effects of faultfinding
                        versus the positive effects of letting the other person save face.</p>
                    <p>
                        Fred Clark of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, told of an incident that occurred in his company: ﬁAt
                        one of our production meetings, a vice president was asking very pointed questions of one of our
                        production supervisors regarding a production process. His tone of voice was aggressive and
                        aimed at pointing out faulty performance on the part of the supervisor. Not wanting to be
                        embarrassed in front of his peers, the supervisor was evasive in his responses. This caused the
                        vice president to lose his temper, berate the supervisor and accuse him of lying.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁAny working relationship that might have existed prior to this encounter was destroyed in a few
                        brief moments. This supervisor, who was basically a good worker, was useless to our company from
                        that time on. A few months later he left our firm and went to work for a competitor, where I
                        understand he is doing a fine job.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        Another class member, Anna Mazzone, related how a similar incident had occurred at her jobŠbut
                        what a difference in approach and results! Ms. Mazzone, a marketing specialist for a food
                        packer, was given her first major assignmentŠthe test-marketing of a new product. She told the
                        class: ﬁWhen the results of the test came in, I was devastated. I had made a serious error in my
                        planning, and the entire test had to be done all over again. To make this worse, I had no time
                        to discuss it 194</p>
                    <p>with my boss before the meeting in which I was to make my report on the project. ﬁWhen I was
                        called on to give the report, I was shaking with fright. I had all I could do to keep from
                        breaking down, but I resolved I would not cry and have all those men make remarks about women
                        not being able to handle a management job because they are too emotional. I made my report
                        briefly and stated that due to an error I would repeat the study before the next meeting. I sat
                        down, expecting my boss to blow up.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁInstead, he thanked me for my work and remarked that it was not unusual for a person to make an
                        error on a new project and that he had confidence that the repeat survey would be accurate and
                        meaningful to the company. He Assured me, in front of all my colleagues, that he had faith in me
                        and I knew I had done my best, and that my lack of experience, not my lack of ability, was the
                        reason for the failure. I left that meeting with my head in the air and with the determination
                        that I would never let that boss of mine down again.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        Even if we are right and the other person is definitely wrong, we only destroy ego by causing
                        someone to lose face. The legendary French aviation pioneer and author Antoine de Saint-Exupéry
                        wrote: "I have no right to say or do anything that diminishes a man in his own eyes. What
                        matters is not what I think of him, but what he thinks of himself. Hurting a man in his dignity
                        is a crime.ﬂ</p>

                    <p>
                        Pete Barlow was an old friend of mine. He had a dog-and-pony act and spent his life traveling
                        with circuses and vaudeville shows. I loved to watch Pete train new dogs for his act. I noticed
                        that the moment a dog showed the slightest improvement, Pete patted and praised him and gave him
                        meat and made a great to-do about it.</p>
                    <p>
                        That™s nothing new. Animal trainers have been using that same technique for centuries.</p>
                    <p>
                        Why, I wonder, don™t we use the same common sense when trying to change people that we use when
                        trying to change dogs? Why don™t we use meat instead of a whip? Why don™t we use praise instead
                        of condemnation? Let us praise even the slightest improvement. That inspires the other person to
                        keep on improving.</p>
                    <p>
                        In his book I Ain™t Much, Baby-But I™m All I Got, the psychologist Jess Lair comments: ﬁPraise
                        is like sunlight to the warm human spirit</p>
                    <p>we cannot flower and grow without it. And yet, while most of us are only too ready to apply to
                        others the cold wind of criticism, we are somehow reluctant to give our fellow the warm sunshine
                        of praise.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        I can look back at my own life and see where a few words of praise have sharply changed my

                        illustrations of the sheer witchery raise.</p>
                    <p>
                        For example, many years ago a boy of ten was working in a factory in Naples, He longed to be a
                        singer, but his first teacher discouraged him. ﬁYou can™t sing,ﬂ he said. "You haven™t any voice
                        at all. It sounds like the wind in the shutters.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>But his mother, a poor peasant woman, put her arms about him and praised him and told him she
                        knew he could sing, she could already see an improvement, and she went barefoot in order to save
                        money to pay for his music lessons. That peasant mother™s praise and encouragement changed that
                        boy™s life. His name was Enrico Caruso, and he became the greatest and most famous opera singer
                        of his age.</p>

                        In the early nineteenth century, a young man in London aspired to be a writer. But everything
                        seemed to be against him. He had never been able to attend school more than four years. His
                        father had been flung in jail because he couldn™t pay his debts, 196</p>
                    <p>and this young man often knew the pangs of hunger. Finally, he got a job pasting labels on
                        bottles of blacking in a rat-infested warehouse, and he slept at night in a dismal attic room
                        with two other boys - guttersnipes from the slums of London. He had so little confidence in his
                        ability to write that he sneaked out and mailed his first manuscript in the dead of night so
                        nobody would laugh at him. Story after story was refused. Finally the great day came when one
                        was accepted. True, he wasn™t paid a shilling for it, but one editor had praised him. One editor
                        had given him recognition. He was so thrilled that he wandered aimlessly around the streets with
                        tears rolling down his cheeks.</p>
                    <p>
                        The praise, the recognition, that he received through getting one story in print, changed his
                        whole life, for if it hadn™t been for that encouragement, he might have spent his entire life
                        working in rat-infested factories. You may have heard of that boy. His name was Charles
                        Dickens.</p>
                    <p>
                        Another boy in London made his living as a clerk in a dry-goods store. He had to get up at five
                        o™clock, sweep out the store, and slave for fourteen hours a day. It was sheer drudgery and he
                        despised it. After two years, he could stand it no longer, so he got up one morning and, without
                        waiting for breakfast, tramped fifteen miles to talk to his mother, who was working as a
                        housekeeper.</p>
                    <p>
                        He was frantic. He pleaded with her. He wept. He swore he would kill himself if he had to remain
                        in the shop any longer. Then he wrote a long, pathetic letter to his old schoolmaster, declaring
                        that he was heartbroken, that he no longer wanted to live. His old schoolmaster gave him a
                        little praise and assured him that he really was very intelligent and fitted for finer things
                        and offered him a job as a teacher.</p>
                    <p>
                        That praise changed the future of that boy and made a lasting impression on the history of
                        English literature. For that boy went on to write innumerable best-selling books and made over a
                        million dollars with his pen. You™ve probably heard of him. His name: H. G. Wells.</p>
                    <p>
                        Use of praise instead of criticism is the basic concept of B. F. Skinner™s teachings. This great
                        contemporary psychologist has shown by experiments with animals and with humans that when
                        criticism is minimized and praise emphasized, the good things people do will be reinforced and
                        the poorer things will atrophy for lack of attention.</p>
                    <p>John Ringelspaugh of Rocky Mount, North Carolina, used this in dealing with his 197</p>
                    <p>children. It seemed that, as in so many families, mother and dad™s chief form of communication
                        with the children was yelling at them. And, as in so many cases, the children became a little
                        worse rather than better after each such session - and so did the parents. There seemed to be no
                        end in sight for this problem.</p>
                    <p>
                        Mr. Ringelspaugh determined to use some of the principles he was learning in our course to solve
                        this situation. He reported: ﬁWe decided to try praise instead of harping on their faults. It
                        wasn™t easy when all we could see were the negative things they were doing; it was really tough
                        to find things to praise. We managed to find something, and within the first day or two some of
                        the really upsetting things they were doing quit happening. Then some of their other faults
                        began to disappear. They began capitalizing on the praise we were giving them. They even began
                        going out of their way to do things right. Neither of us could believe it. Of course, it didn™t
                        last forever, but the norm reached after things leveled off was so much better. It was no longer
                        necessary to react the way we used to. The children were doing far more right things than wrong
                        ones.ﬂ All of this was a result of praising the slightest improvement in the children rather
                        than condemning everything they did wrong.</p>
                    <p>
                        This works on the job too. Keith Roper of Woodland Hills, California, applied this principle to
                        a situation in his company. Some material came to him in his print shop which was of
                        exceptionally high quality. The printer who had done this job was a new employee who had been
                        having difficulty adjusting to the job. His supervisor was upset about what he considered a
                        negative attitude and was seriously thinking of terminating his services.</p>
                    <p>When Mr. Roper was informed of this situation, he personally went over to the print shop and had
                        a talk with the young man. He told him how pleased he was with the work he had just received and
                        pointed out it was the best work he had seen produced in that shop for some time. He pointed out
                        exactly why it was superior and how important the young man™s contribution was to the
                        company,</p>
                    <p>
                        Do you think this affected that young printer™s attitude toward the company? Within days there
                        was a complete turnabout. He told several of his co-workers about the conversation and how
                        someone in the company really appreciated good work. And from that day on, he was a loyal and
                        dedicated worker.</p>
                    <p>
                        What Mr. Roper did was not just flatter the young printer and say ﬁYou™re good.ﬂ He specifically
                        pointed out how his work was superior</p>
                    <p>Because he had singled out a specific accomplishment, rather than just making general flattering
                        remarks, his 198</p>
                    <p>praise became much more meaningful to the person to whom it was given. Everybody likes to be
                        praised, but when praise is specific, it comes across as sincere - not something the other
                        person may be saying just to make one feel good.</p>
                    <p>
                        Remember, we all crave appreciation and recognition, and will do almost anything to get it. But
                        nobody wants insincerity. Nobody wants flattery.</p>
                    <p>
                        Let me repeat: The principles taught in this book will work only when they come from the heart.
                        I am not advocating a bag of tricks. I am talking about a new way of life.</p>
                    <p>
                        Talk about changing people. If you and I will inspire the people with whom we come in contact to
                        a realization of the hidden treasures they possess, we can do far more than change people. We
                        can literally transform them.</p>
                    <p>Exaggeration? Then listen to these sage words from William James, one of the most distinguished
                        psychologists and philosophers America has ever produced:</p>
                    <p>Compared with what we ought to be, we are only half awake. We are making use of only a small part
                        of our physical and mental resources. Stating the thing broadly, the human individual thus lives
                        far within his limits. He possesses powers of various sorts which he habitually fails to
                        use.</p>
                    <p>
                        Yes, you who are reading these lines possess powers of various sorts which you habitually fail
                        to use; and one of these powers you are probably not using to the fullest extent is your magic
                        ability to praise people and inspire them with a realization of their latent possibilities.</p>
                    <p>
                        Abilities wither under criticism; they blossom under encouragement. To become a more effective
                        leader of people, apply . . .</p>
                    <p>PRINCIPLE 6</p>
                    <p>- Praise the slightest improvement and praise every improvement.</p>

                    <p>
                        What do you do when a person who has been a good worker begins to turn in shoddy work? You can
                        fire him or her, but that really doesn™t solve anything. You can berate the worker, but this
                        usually causes resentment. Henry Henke, a service manager for a large truck dealership in
                        Lowell, Indiana, had a mechanic whose work had become less than satisfactory. Instead of bawling
                        him out or threatening him, Mr. Henke called him into his office and had a heart-to-heart talk
                        with him.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁBill,ﬂ he said, ﬁyou are a fine mechanic. You have been in this line of work for a good number
                        of years. You have repaired many vehicles to the customers™ satisfaction. In fact, we™ve had a
                        number of compliments about the good work you have done. Yet, of late, the time you take to
                        complete each job has been increasing and your work has not been up to your own old standards.
                        Because you have been such an outstanding mechanic in the past, I felt sure you would want to
                        know that I am not happy with this situation, and perhaps jointly we could find some way to
                        correct the problem.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        Bill responded that he hadn™t realized he had been falling down in his duties and assured his
                        boss that the work he was getting was not out of his range of expertise and he would try to
                        improve in the future.</p>
                    <p>
                        Did he do it? You can be sure he did. He once again became a fast and thorough mechanic. With
                        that reputation Mr. Henke had given him to live up to, how could he do anything else but turn
                        out work comparable to that which he had done in the past.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁThe average person,ﬂ said Samuel Vauclain, then president of the Baldwin Locomotive Works, "can
                        be led readily if you have his or her respect and if you show that you respect that person for
                        some kind of ability.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        In short, if you want to improve a person in a certain aspect, act as though that particular
                        trait were already one of his or her outstanding characteristics. Shakespeare said ﬁAssume a
                        virtue, if you have it not.ﬂ And it might be well to assume and state openly that other people
                        have the virtue you want them to develop. Give them a fine reputation to live up to, and they
                        will make prodigious efforts rather than see you disillusioned.</p>

                    <p>Georgette Leblanc, in her book Souvenirs, My Life with Maeterlinck, describes the startling
                        transformation of a humble Belgian Cinderella.</p>

                        ﬁA servant girl from a neighboring hotel brought my meals,ﬂ she wrote. ﬁShe was called ‚Marie
                        the Dish washer™ because she had starte</p>
                    <p>her career as a scullery assistant. She was a kind of monster, cross-eyed, bandylegged, poor in
                        flesh and spirit.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁOne day, while she was holding my plate of macaroni</p>
                    <p>in her red hand, I said to her point-blank, ‚Marie, you do not know what treasures are within
                        you.™</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁAccustomed to holding back her emotion, Marie waited a few moments, not daring to risk the
                        slightest gesture for fear of a castastrophe. Then she put the dish on the table, sighed and
                        said ingenuously, ‚Madame, I would never have believed it.™ She did not doubt, she did not ask a
                        question. She simply went back to the kitchen and repeated what I had said, and such is the
                        force of faith that no one made fun of her. From that day on, she was even given a certain
                        consideration. But the most curious change of all occurred in the humble Marie herself.
                        Believing she was the tabernacle of unseen marvels, she began taking care of her face and body
                        so carefully that her starved youth seemed to bloom and modestly hide her plainness.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁTwo months later, she announced her coming marriage with the nephew of the chef. ‚I™m going to

                        Bill Parker, a sales representative for a food company in Daytona Beach, Florida, was very
                        excited about the new line of products his company was introducing and was upset when the
                        manager of a large independent food market turned down the opportunity to carry it in his store.
                        Bill brooded all day over this rejection and decided to return to the store before he went home

                        One morning Dr. Martin Fitzhugh, a dentist in Dublin, Ireland, was shocked when one of his
                        patients pointed out to him that the metal cup holder which she was using to rinse her mouth was
                        not very clean. True, the patient drank from the paper cup, not the holder, but it certainly was
                        not professional to use tarnished equipment.</p>
                    <p>
                        When the patient left, Dr. Fitzhugh retreated to his private office to write a note to Bridgit,
                        the charwoman, who came twice a week to clean his office. He wrote:</p>
                    <p>

                        to a mirror-like finish, as had my chair, which I nearly slid out of. When I went into the

                        in its receptacle. I had given my char-woman a fine reputation to live up to, and because of
                        this small gesture she outperformed all her past efforts. How much additional time did she spend

                        When Mrs. Ruth Hopkins, a fourth-grade teacher in Brooklyn, New York, looked at her class roster
                        the first day of school, her excitement and joy of starting a new term was tinged with anxiety.
                        In her class this year she would have Tommy T., the school™s most notorious ﬁbad boy.ﬂ His
                        third-grade teacher had constantly complained about Tommy to colleagues, the principal and
                        anyone else who would listen. He was not just mischievous; he caused serious discipline problems
                        in the class, picked fights with the boys, teased the girls, was fresh to the teacher, and
                        seemed to get worse as he grew older. His only redeeming feature was his ability to 202</p>
                    <p>learn rapidly and master the-school work easily.</p>
                    <p>
                        Mrs. Hopkins decided to face the ﬁTommy problemﬂ immediately. When she greeted her new students,
                        she made little comments to each of them: ﬁRose, that™s a pretty dress you are wearing,ﬂ
                        ﬁAlicia, I hear you draw beautifully.ﬂ When she came to Tommy, she looked him straight in the
                        eyes and said, ﬁTommy, I understand you are a natural leader. I™m going to depend on you to help
                        me make this class the best class in the fourth grade this year.ﬂ She reinforced this over the
                        first few days by complimenting Tommy on everything he did and commenting on how this showed
                        what a good student he was. With that reputation to live up to, even a nine-year-old couldn™t
                        let her down - and he didn™t.</p>

                        8 - MAKE THE FAULT SEEM EASY TO CORRECT</p>
                    <p>
                        A bachelor friend of mine, about forty years old, became engaged, and his fiancée persuaded him
                        to take some belated dancing lessons. ﬁThe Lord knows I needed dancing lessons,ﬂ he confessed as
                        he told me the story, ﬁfor I danced just as I did when I first started twenty years ago. The
                        first teacher I engaged probably told me the truth. She said I was all wrong; I would just have
                        to forget everything and begin all over again. But that took the heart out of me. I had no
                        incentive to go on. So I quit her.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁThe next teacher may have been lying, but I liked it. She said nonchalantly that my dancing was
                        a bit old-fashioned perhaps, but the fundamentals were all right, and she assured me I wouldn™t
                        have any trouble learning a few new steps. The first teacher had discouraged me by emphasizing
                        my mistakes. This new teacher did the opposite. She kept praising the things I did right and
                        minimizing my errors. ‚You have a natural sense of rhythm,™ she assured me. ‚You really are a
                        natural-born dancer.™ Now my common sense tells me that I always have been and always will be a
                        fourth-rate dancer; yet, deep in my heart, I still like to think that maybe she meant it. To be
                        sure, I was paying her to say it; but why bring that up?</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁAt any rate, I know I am a better dancer than I would have been if she hadn™t told me I had a
                        natural sense of rhythm. That encouraged me. That gave me hope. That made me want to
                        improve.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        Tell your child, your spouse, or your employee that he or she is stupid or dumb at a certain
                        thing, has no gift for it, and is doing it all wrong, and you have destroyed almost every
                        incentive to try to improve. But use the opposite techniqueŠbe liberal with your encouragement,
                        make the thing seem easy to do, let the other person know that you have faith in his ability to
                        do it, that he has an undeveloped flair for itŠand he will practice until the dawn comes in the
                        window in order to excel.</p>
                    <p>
                        Lowell Thomas, a superb artist in human relations, used this technique, He gave you confidence,
                        inspired you with courage and faith. For example, I spent a weekend with Mr. and Mrs. Thomas;
                        and on Saturday night, I was asked to sit in on a friendly bridge game before a roaring fire.
                        Bridge? Oh, no! No! No! Not me. I knew nothing about it. The game had always been a black
                        mystery to me, No! No! Impossible!</p>
                    <p>204</p>
                    <p>ﬁWhy, Dale, it is no trick at all,ﬂ Lowell replied. ﬁThere is nothing to bridge except memory and
                        judgment. You™ve written articles on memory. Bridge will be a cinch for you. It™s right up your
                        alley.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        And presto, almost before I realized what I was doing, I found myself for the first time at a
                        bridge table. All because I was told I had a natural flair for it and the game was made to seem
                        easy.</p>
                    <p>
                        Speaking of bridge reminds me of Ely Culbertson, whose books on bridge have been translated into
                        a dozen languages and have sold more than a million copies. Yet he told me he never would have
                        made a profession out of the game if a certain young woman hadn™t assured him he had a flair for
                        it.</p>
                    <p>
                        When he came to America in 1922, he tried to get a job teaching in philosophy and sociology, but
                        he couldn™t. Then he tried selling coal, and he failed at that</p>
                    <p>
                        Then he tried selling coffee, and he failed at that, too.</p>
                    <p>
                        He had played some bridge, but it had never occurred to him in those days that someday he would
                        teach it. He was not only a poor card player, but he was also very stubborn. He asked so many
                        questions and held so many post-mortem examinations that no one wanted to play with him.</p>
                    <p>
                        Then he met a pretty bridge teacher, Josephine Dillon, fell in love and married her. She noticed
                        how carefully he analyzed his cards and persuaded him that he was a potential genius at the card
                        table. It was that encouragement and that alone, Culbertson told me, that caused him to make a
                        profession of bridge.</p>

                        Clarence M. Jones, one of the instructors of our course in Cincinnati, Ohio, told how
                        encouragement and making faults seem easy to correct completely changed the life of his son.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁIn 1970 my son David, who was then fifteen years old, came to live with me in Cincinnati. He
                        had led a rough life. In 1958 his head was cut open in a car accident, leaving a very bad scar
                        on his forehead. In 1960 his mother and I were divorced and he moved to Dallas, Texas, with his
                        mother. Until he was fifteen he had spent most of his school years in special classes for slow
                        learners in the Dallas school system. Possibly because of the scar, school administrators had
                        decided he was brain-injured and could not function at a normal level. He was two years behind
                        his age 205</p>
                    <p>group, so he was only in the seventh grade. Yet he did not know his multiplication tables, added
                        on his fingers and could barely read.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁThere was one positive point. He loved to work on radio and TV sets. He wanted to become a TV
                        technician. I encouraged this and pointed out that he needed math to qualify for the training. I
                        decided to help him become proficient in this subject. We obtained four sets of flash cards:
                        multiplication, division, addition and subtraction. As we went through the cards, we put the
                        correct answers in a discard stack. When David missed one, I gave him the correct answer and
                        then put the card in the repeat stack until there were no cards left. I made a big deal out of
                        each card he got right, particularly if he had missed it previously. Each night we would go
                        through the repeat stack until there were no cards left.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁEach night we timed the exercise with a stop watch. I promised him that when he could get all
                        the cards correct in eight minutes with no incorrect answers, we would quit doing it every
                        night. This seemed an impossible goal to David. The first night it took 52 minutes, the second
                        night, 48, then 45, 44, 41 then under 40 minutes. We celebrated each reduction. I™d call in my
                        wife, and we would both hug him and we™d all dance a jig. At the end of the month he was doing
                        all the cards perfectly in less than eight minutes. When he made a small improvement he would
                        ask to do it again. He had made the fantastic discovery that learning was easy and fun.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁNaturally his grades in algebra took a jump. It is amazing how much easier algebra is when you
                        can multiply. He astonished himself by bringing home a B in math. That had never happened
                        before. Other changes came with almost unbelievable rapidity. His reading improved rapidly, and
                        he began to use his natural talents in drawing. Later in the school year his science teacher
                        assigned him to develop an exhibit. He chose to develop a highly complex series of models to
                        demonstrate the effect of levers. It required skill not only in drawing and model making but in
                        applied mathematics. The exhibit took first prize in his school™s science fair and was entered
                        in the city competition and won third prize for the entire city of Cincinnati.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁThat did it. Here was a kid who had flunked two grades, who had been told he was
                        ‚brain-damaged,™ who had been called ‚Frankenstein™ by his classmates and told his brains must
                        have leaked out of the cut on his head. Suddenly he discovered he could really learn and
                        accomplish things. The result? From the last quarter of the eighth grade all the way through
                        high school, he never failed to make the honor roll; in high school he was elected to the
                        national honor society. Once he found learning 206</p>
                    <p>was easy, his whole life changed.ﬂ</p>

                        9 - MAKING PEOPLE GLAD TO DO WHAT YOU WANT</p>
                    <p>
                        Back in 1915, America was aghast. For more than a year, the nations of Europe had been
                        slaughtering one another on a scale never before dreamed of in all the bloody annals of mankind.
                        Could peace be brought about? No one knew. But Woodrow Wilson was determined to try. He would
                        send a personal representative, a peace emissary, to counsel with the warlords of Europe.</p>
                    <p>William Jennings Bryan, secretary of state, Bryan, the peace advocate, longed to go. He saw a
                        chance to perform a great service and make his name immortal. But Wilson appointed another man,
                        his intimate friend and advisor Colonel Edward M. House; and it was House™s thorny task to break
                        the unwelcome news to Bryan without giving him offense.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁBryan was distinctly disappointed when he heard I was to go to Europe as the peace emissary,ﬂ
                        Colonel House records in his diary. ﬁHe said he had planned to do this himself . . .</p>
                    <p>
                        "I replied that the President thought it would be unwise for anyone to do this officially, and
                        that his going would attract a great deal of attention and people would wonder why he was there.
                        . . ."</p>
                    <p>
                        You see the intimation? House practically told Bryan that he was too important for the job - and
                        Bryan was satisfied.</p>
                    <p>
                        Colonel House, adroit, experienced in the ways of the world, was following one of the important
                        rules of human relations: Always make the other person happy about doing the thing you
                        suggest.</p>
                    <p>
                        Woodrow Wilson followed that policy even when inviting William Gibbs McAdoo to become a member
                        of his cabinet. That was the highest honor he could confer upon anyone, and yet Wilson extended
                        the invitation in such a way as to make McAdoo feel doubly important. Here is the story in
                        McAdoo's own words: ﬁHe [Wilson] said that he was making up his cabinet and that he would be
                        very glad if I would accept a place in it as Secretary of the Treasury. He had a delightful way
                        of putting things; he created the impression that by accepting this great honor I would be doing
                        him a favor.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>208</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, Wilson didn™t always employ such taut. If he had, history might have been
                        different. For example, Wilson didn™t make the Senate and the Republican Party happy by entering
                        the United States in the League of Nations. Wilson refused to take such prominent Republican
                        leaders as Elihu Root or Charles Evans Hughes or Henry Cabot Lodge to the peace conference with
                        him. Instead, he took along unknown men from his own party. He snubbed the Republicans, refused
                        to let them feel that the League was their idea as well as his, refused to let them have a
                        finger in the pie; and, as a result of this crude handling of human relations, wrecked his own
                        career, ruined his health, shortened his life, caused America to stay out of the League, and
                        altered the history of the world.</p>

                        Statesmen and diplomats aren™t the only ones who use this
                        make-a-person-happy-yo-do-things-you-want-them-to- do approach. Dale O. Ferrier of Fort Wayne,
                        Indiana, told how he encouraged one of his young children to willingly do the chore he was
                        assigned.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁOne of Jeff™s chores was to pick up pears from under the pear tree so the person who was mowing
                        underneath wouldn™t have to stop to pick them up. He didn™t like this chore, and frequently it
                        was either not done at all or it was done so poorly that the mower had to stop and pick up
                        several pears that he had missed. Rather than have an eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation about it,
                        one day I said to him: ‚Jeff, I™ll make a deal with you. For every bushel basket full of pears
                        you pick up, I™ll pay you one dollar. But after you are finished, for every pear I find left in
                        the yard, I™ll take away a dollar. How does that sound?™ As you would expect, he not only picked
                        up all of the pears, but I had to keep an eye on him to see that he didn™t pull a few off the
                        trees to fill up some of the baskets.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        I knew a man who had to refuse many invitations to speak, invitations extended by friends,
                        invitations coming from people to whom he was obligated; and yet he did it so adroitly that the
                        other person was at least contented with his refusal. How did he do it? Not by merely talking
                        about the fact that he was too busy and too-this and too-that. No, after expressing his
                        appreciation of the invitation and regretting his inability to accept it, he suggested a
                        substitute speaker. In other words, he didn™t give the other person any time to feel unhappy
                        about the refusal, He immediately changed the other person™s thoughts to some other speaker who
                        could accept the invitation.</p>
                    <p>
                        Gunter Schmidt, who took our course in West Germany, told of an employee in the food store he
                        managed who was negligent about putting the proper price tags on the 209</p>
                    <p>shelves where the items were displayed. This caused confusion and customer complaints. Reminders,
                        admonitions, confrontations, with her about this did not do much good. Finally, Mr. Schmidt
                        called her into his office and told her he was appointing her Supervisor of Price Tag Posting
                        for the entire store and she would be responsible for keeping all of the shelves properly
                        tagged. This new responsibility and title changed her attitude completely, and she fulfiled her
                        duties satisfactorily from then on.</p>
                    <p>
                        Childish? Perhaps. But that is what they said to Napoleon when he created the Legion of Honor
                        and distributed 15,000 crosses to his soldiers and made eighteen of his generals ﬁMarshals of
                        Franceﬂ and called his troops the ﬁGrand Army.ﬂ Napoleon was criticized for giving ﬁtoysﬂ to
                        war-hardened veterans, and Napoleon replied, ﬁMen are ruled by toys.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        This technique of giving titles and authority worked for Napoleon and it will work for you. For
                        example, a friend of mine, Mrs. Ernest Gent of Scarsdale, New York, was troubled by boys running
                        across and destroying her lawn. She tried criticism. She tried coaxing. Neither worked. Then she
                        tried giving the worst sinner in the gang a title and a feeling of authority. She made him her
                        ﬁdetectiveﬂ and put him in charge of keeping all trespassers off her lawn. That solved her
                        problem. Her ﬁdetectiveﬂ built a bonfire in the backyard, heated an iron red hot, and threatened
                        to brand any boy who stepped on the lawn.</p>

                        The effective leader should keep the following guidelines in mind when it is necessary to change
                        attitudes or behavior:</p>
                    <p>
                        1. Be sincere. Do not promise anything that you cannot deliver. Forget about the benefits to
                        yourself and concentrate on the benefits to the other person.</p>
                    <p>
                        2. Know exactly what it is you want the other person to do.</p>
                    <p>
                        3. Be empathetic. Ask yourself what is it the other person really wants.</p>
                    <p>
                        4. Consider the benefits that person will receive from doing what you suggest.</p>
                    <p>
                        5. Match those benefits to the other person™s wants.</p>
                    <p>6. When you make your request, put it in a form that will convey to the other person the idea
                        that he personally will benefit. We could give a curt order like this: " John, 210</p>
                    <p>we have customers coming in tomorrow and I need the stockroom cleaned out. So sweep it out, put
                        the stock in neat piles on the shelves and polish the counter.ﬂ Or we could express the same
                        idea by showing John the benefits he will get from doing the task: ﬁJohn, we have a job that
                        should be completed right away. If it is done now, we won™t be faced with it later. I am
                        bringing some customers in tomorrow to show our facilities. I would like to show them the
                        stockroom, but it is in poor shape. If you could sweep it out, put the stock in neat piles on
                        the shelves, and polish the counter, it would make us look efficient and you will have done your
                        part to provide a good company image.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        Will John be happy about doing what you suggest? Probably not very happy, but happier than if
                        you had not pointed out the benefits. Assuming you know that John has pride in the way his
                        stockroom looks and is interested in contributing to the company image, he will be more likely
                        to be cooperative. It also will have been pointed out to John that the job would have to be done
                        eventually and by doing it now, he won™t be faced with it later.</p>
                    <p>
                        It is naïve to believe you will always get a favorable reaction from other persons when you use
                        these approaches, but the experience of most people shows that you are more likely to change
                        attitudes this way than by not using these principles - and if you increase your successes by
                        even a mere 10 percent, you have become 10 percent more effective as a leader than you were
                        before - and that is your benefit.</p>
                    <p>
                        People are more likely to do what you would like them to do when you use . . .</p>
                    <p>PRINCIPLE 9 - Make the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest.</p>
                    <p>
                        In a Nutshell</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p> BE A LEADER</p>
                    <p>
                        A leader™s job often includes changing your people™s attitudes and behavior. Some suggestions to
                        accomplish this:</p>
                    <p>
                        PRINCIPLE 1 - Begin with praise and honest appreciation.</p>
                    <p>
                        PRINCIPLE 2 - Call attention to people™s mistakes indirectly.</p>
                    <p>
                        PRINCIPLE 3 - Talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other person. 211</p>
                    <p>
                        PRINCIPLE 4 - Ask questions instead of giving direct orders.</p>
                    <p>
                        PRINCIPLE 5 - Let the other person save face.</p>
                    <p>
                        PRINCIPLE 6 - Praise the slightest improvement and praise every improvement. Be ﬁhearty in your
                        approbation and lavish in your praise.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        PRINCIPLE 7 - Give the other person a fine reputation to live up to.</p>
                    <p>
                        PRINCIPLE 8 - Use encouragement. Make the fault seem easy to correct.</p>
                    <p>
                        PRINCIPLE 9 - Make the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest.</p>
