                    <h3> How to Win People to Your Way of Thinking</h3>
                    <p>1 - YOU CAN™T WIN AN ARGUMENT</p>
                    <p>
                        Shortly after the close of World War I, I learned an invaluable lesson one night in London. I
                        was manager at the time for Sir Ross Smith. During the war, Sir Ross had been the Australian ace
                        out in Palestine; and shortly after peace was declared, he astonished the world by flying
                        halfway around it in thirty days. No such feat had ever been attempted before. It created a
                        tremendous sensation. The Australian government awarded him fifty thousand dollars; the King of
                        England knighted him; and, for a while, he was the most talked-about man under the Union Jack. I
                        was attending a banquet one night given in Sir Ross™s honor; and during the dinner, the man
                        sitting next to me told a humorous story which hinged on the quotation ﬁThere™s a divinity that
                        shapes our ends, rough-hew them how we will.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        The raconteur mentioned that the quotation was from the Bible. He was wrong. I knew that, I knew
                        it positively. There couldn™t be the slightest doubt about it. And so, to get a feeling of
                        importance and display my superiority, I appointed myself as an unsolicited and unwelcome
                        committee of one to correct him. He stuck to his guns. What? From Shakespeare? Impossible!
                        Absurd! That quotation was from the Bible. And he knew it.</p>
                    <p>The storyteller was sitting on my right; and Frank Gammond, an old friend of mine, was seated at
                        my left. Mr. Gammond had devoted years to the study of Shakespeare, So the storyteller and I
                        agreed to submit the question to Mr. Gammond. Mr. Gammond listened, kicked me under the table,
                        and then said: ﬁDale, you are wrong. The gentleman is right. It is from the Bible.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        On our way home that night, I said to Mr. Gammond: ﬁFrank, you knew that quotation was from
                        Shakespeare,ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁYes, of course,ﬂ he replied, "Hamlet, Act Five, Scene Two. But we were guests at a festive
                        occasion, my dear Dale. Why prove to a man he is wrong? Is that going to make him like you? Why
                        not let him save his face? He didn™t ask for your opinion. He didn™t want it. Why argue with
                        him? Always avoid the acute angle.ﬂ The man who said that taught me a lesson I™ll never forget.
                        I not only had made the storyteller uncomfortable, but had put my friend in an embarrassing
                        situation. How 112</p>
                    <p>much better it would have been had I not become argumentative.</p>
                    <p>
                        It was a sorely needed lesson because I had been an inveterate arguer. During my youth, I had
                        argued with my brother about everything under the Milky Way. When I went to college, I studied
                        logic and argumentation and went in for debating contests. Talk about being from Missouri, I was
                        born there. I had to be shown. Later, I taught debating and argumentation in New York; and once,
                        I am ashamed to admit, I planned to write a book on the subject. Since then, I have listened to,
                        engaged in, and watched the effect of thousands of arguments. As a result of all this, I have
                        come to the conclusion that there is only one way under high heaven to get the best of an
                        argument - and that is to avoid it .</p>
                    <p>
                        Avoid it as you would avoid rattlesnakes and earthquakes.</p>
                    <p>Nine times out of ten, an argument ends with each of the contestants more firmly convinced than
                        ever that he is absolutely right.</p>
                    <p>
                        You can™t win an argument. You can™t because if you lose it, you lose it; and if you win it, you
                        lose it. Why? Well, suppose you triumph over the other man and shoot his argument full of holes
                        and prove that he is non compos mentis. Then what? You will feel fine. But what about him? You
                        have made him feel inferior. You have hurt his pride. He will resent your triumph. And -</p>
                    <p>A man convinced against his will</p>
                    <p>Is of the same opinion still.</p>
                    <p>
                        Years ago Patrick J. O™Haire joined one of my classes. He had had little education, and how he
                        loved a scrap! He had once been a chauffeur, and he came to me because he had been trying,
                        without much success, to sell trucks. A little questioning brought out the fact that he was
                        continually scrapping with and antagonizing the very people he was trying to do business with,
                        If a prospect said anything derogatory about the trucks he was selling, Pat saw red and was
                        right at the customer™s throat. Pat won a lot of arguments in those days. As he said to me
                        afterward, "I often walked out of an office saving: ‚I told that bird something.™ Sure I had
                        told him something, but I hadn™t sold him anything.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        Mv first problem was not to teach Patrick J. O™Haire to talk. My immediate task was to train him
                        to refrain from talking and to avoid verbal fights.</p>
                    <p>113</p>
                    <p>Mr. O™Haire became one of the star salesmen for the White Motor Company in New York. How did he
                        do it? Here is his story in his own words: ﬁIf I walk into a buyer™s office now and he says:
                        ‚What? A White truck?</p>
                    <p>
                        They™re no good! I wouldn™t take one if you gave it to me. I™m going to buy the Whose-It truck,™
                        I say, ‚The Whose-It is a good truck. If you buy the Whose-It, you™ll never make a mistake. The
                        Whose-Its are made by a fine company and sold by good people.™</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁHe is speechless then. There is no room for an argument. If he says the Whose-It is best and I
                        say sure it is, he has to stop. He can™t keep on all afternoon saying, ‚It™s the best™ when I™m
                        agreeing with him. We then get off the subject of Whose-It and I begin to talk about the good
                        points of the White truck.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁThere was a time when a remark like his first one would have made me see scarlet and red and
                        orange. I would start arguing against the Whose-It; and the more I argued against it, the more
                        my prospect argued in favor of it; and the more he argued, the more he sold himself on my
                        competitor™s product.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁAs I look back now I wonder how I was ever able to sell anything. I lost years of my life in
                        scrapping and arguing. I keep my mouth shut now. It pays.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        As wise old Ben Franklin used to say:</p>
                    <p>
                        If you argue and rankle and contradict, you may achieve a victory sometimes; but it will be an
                        empty victory because you will never get your opponent™s good will.</p>
                    <p>
                        So figure it out for yourself. Which would you rather have, an academic, theatrical victory or a
                        person™s good will? You can seldom have both.</p>
                    <p>
                        The Boston Transcript once printed this bit of significant doggerel:</p>
                    <p>Here lies the body of William Jay,</p>
                    <p>Who died maintaining his right of way.</p>
                    <p>He was right, dead right, as he sped along, But he™s just as dead as if he were wrong.</p>
                    <p>
                        You may be right, dead right, as you speed along in your argument; but as far as changing
                        another™s mind is concerned, you will probably be just as futile as if you 114</p>
                    <p>were wrong.</p>
                    <p>
                        Frederick S. Parsons, an income tax consultant, had been disputing and wrangling for an hour
                        with a gover-ment tax inspector. An item of nine thousand dollars was at stake. Mr. Parsons
                        claimed that this nine thousand dollars was in reality a bad debt, that it would never be
                        collected, that it ought not to be taxed. ﬁBad debt, my eye !" retorted the inspector. ﬁIt must
                        be taxed.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁThis inspector was cold, arrogant and stubborn,ﬂ Mr. Parsons said as he told the story to the
                        class. ﬁReason was wasted and so were facts. . . The longer we argued, the more stubborn he
                        became. So I decided to avoid argument, change the subject, and give him appreciation.</p>
                    <p>
                        "I said, ‚I suppose this is a very petty matter in comparison with the really important and
                        difficult decisions you™re required to make. I™ve made a study of taxation myself. But I™ve had
                        to get my knowledge from books. You are getting yours from the firing line of experience. I
                        sometime wish I had a job like yours. It would teach me a lot.™ I meant every word I said.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁWell.ﬂ The inspector straightened up in his chair, leaned back, and talked for a long time
                        about his work, telling me of the clever frauds he had uncovered. His tone gradually became
                        friendly, and presently he was telling me about his children. As he left, he advised me that he
                        would consider my problem further and give me his decision in a few days.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁHe called at my office three days later and informed me that he had decided to leave the tax
                        return exactly as it was filed.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        This tax inspector was demonstrating one of the most common of human frailties. He wanted a
                        feeling of importance; and as long as Mr. Parsons argued with him,</p>
                    <p>he got his feeling of importance by loudly asserting his authority. But as soon as his importance
                        was admitted and the argument stopped and he was permitted to expand his ego, he became a
                        sympathetic and kindly human being.</p>
                    <p>
                        Buddha said: ﬁHatred is never ended by hatred but by love," and a misunder- standing is never
                        ended by an argument but by tact, diplomacy, conciliation and a sympathetic desire to see the
                        other person™s viewpoint.</p>
                    <p>Lincoln once reprimanded a young army officer for indulging in a violent 115</p>
                    <p>controversy with an associate. ﬁNo man who is resolved to make the most of himself,ﬂ said
                        Lincoln, "can spare time for personal contention. Still less can he afford to take the
                        consequences, including the vitiation of his temper and the loss of self-control. Yield larger
                        things to which you show no more than equal rights; and yield lesser ones though clearly your
                        own. Better give your path to a dog than be bitten by him in contesting for the right. Even
                        killing the dog would not cure the bite.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        In an article in Bits and Pieces, (published by The Economics Press, Fairfield, N.J).some
                        suggestions are made on how to keep a disagreement from becoming an argument:</p>
                    <p>
                        Welcome the disagreement. Remember the slogan, ﬁWhen two partners always agree, one of them is
                        not necessary.ﬂ If there is some point you haven™t thought about, be thankful if it is brought
                        to your attention. Perhaps this disagreement is your opportunity to be corrected before you make
                        a serious mistake.</p>
                    <p>Distrust your first instinctive impression. Our first natural reaction in a disagreeable
                        situation is to be defensive. Be careful. Keep calm and watch out for your first reaction. It
                        may be you at your worst, not your best.</p>
                    <p>
                        Control your temper. Remember, you can measure the size of a person by what makes him or her
                        angry.</p>
                    <p>
                        Listen first. Give your opponents a chance to talk. Let them finish. Do not resist, defend or
                        debate. This only raises barriers. Try to build bridges of understanding. Don™t build higher
                        barriers of misunderstanding.</p>
                    <p>
                        Look for areas of agreement. When you have heard your opponents out, dwell first on the points
                        and areas on which you agree.</p>
                    <p>Be honest, Look for areas where you can admit error and say so. Apologize for your mistakes. It
                        will help disarm your opponents and reduce defensiveness.</p>
                    <p>
                        Promise to think over your opponents™ ideas and study them carefully. And mean it. Your
                        opponents may be right. It is a lot easier at this stage to agree to think about their points
                        than to move rapidly ahead and find yourself in a position where your opponents can say: ﬁWe
                        tried to tell you, but you wouldn™t listen.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>116</p>
                    <p>Thank your opponents sincerely for their interest. Anyone who takes the time to disagree with you
                        is interested in the same things you are. Think of them as people who really want to help you,
                        and you may turn your opponents into friends.</p>
                    <p>Postpone action to give both sides time to think through the problem. Suggest that a new meeting
                        be held later that day or the next day, when all the facts may be brought to bear. In
                        preparation for this meeting, ask yourself some hard questions:</p>
                    <p>
                        Could my opponents be right? Partly right? Is there truth or merit in their position or
                        argument? Is my reaction one that will relieve the problem, or will it just relieve any
                        frustration? Will my reaction drive my opponents further away or draw them closer to me? Will my
                        reaction elevate the estimation good people have of me? Will I win or lose? What price will I
                        have to pay if I win? If I am quiet about it, will the disagreement blow over? Is this difficult
                        situation an opportunity for me?</p>
                    <p>Opera tenor Jan Peerce, after he was married nearly fifty years, once said: "My wife and I made a
                        pact a long time ago, and we™ve kept it no matter how angry we™ve grown with each other. When
                        one yells, the other should listenŠbecause when two people yell, there is no communication, just
                        noise and bad vibrations.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>PRINCIPLE 1 - The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it.</p>
                    <p>
                    </p>

                    <p>117</p>
                    <p>2 - A SURE WAY OF MAKING ENEMIESŠAND HOW TO AVOID IT</p>
                    <p>When Theodore Roosevelt was in the White House, he confessed that if he could be right 75 percent
                        of the time, he would reach the highest measure of his expectation.</p>
                    <p>If that was the highest rating that one of the most distinguished men of the twentieth century
                        could hope to obtain, what about you and me?</p>
                    <p>
                        If you can be sure of being right only 55 percent of the time, you can go down to Wall Street
                        and make a million dollars a day. If you can™t be sure of being right even 55 percent of the
                        time, why should you tell other people they are wrong?</p>
                    <p>
                        You can tell people they are wrong by a look or an intonation or a gesture just as eloquently as
                        you can in words - and if you tell them they are wrong, do you make them want to agree with you?
                        Never! For you have struck a direct blow at their intelligence, judgment, pride and
                        self-respect. That will make them want to strike back. But it will never make them want to
                        change their minds. You may then hurl at them all the logic of a Plato or an Immanuel Kant, but
                        you will not alter their opinions, for you have hurt their feelings.</p>
                    <p>Never begin by announcing "I am going to prove so-and-so to you.ﬂ That™s bad. That™s tantamount
                        to saying: ﬁI™m smarter than you are, I™m going to tell you a thing or two and make you change
                        your mind.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        That is a challenge. It arouses opposition and makes the listener want to battle with you before
                        you even start.</p>
                    <p>
                        It is difficult, under even the most benign conditions, to change people™s minds. So why make it
                        harder? Why handicap yourself?</p>
                    <p>
                        If you are going to prove anything, don™t let anybody know it. Do it so subtly, so adroitly,
                        that no one will feel that you are doing it. This was expressed succinctly by Alexander
                        Pope:</p>
                    <p>Men must be taught as if you taught them not</p>
                    <p>And things unknown proposed as things forgot.</p>
                    <p>
                        Over three hundred years ago Galileo said:</p>
                    <p>118</p>
                    <p>You cannot teach a man anything; you can only help him to find it within himself.</p>
                    <p>
                        As Lord Chesterfield said to his son:</p>
                    <p>
                        Be wiser than other people if you can; but do not tell them so.</p>
                    <p>
                        Socrates said repeatedly to his followers in Athens:</p>
                    <p>
                        One thing only I know, and that is that I know nothing.</p>
                    <p>
                        Well, I can™t hope to be any smarter than Socrates, so I have quit telling people they are
                        wrong. And I find that it pays.</p>
                    <p>
                        If a person makes a statement that you think is wrong - yes, even that you know is wrong - isn™t
                        it better to begin by saying: ﬁWell, now, look, I thought otherwise, but I may be wrong. I
                        frequently am. And if I am wrong, I want to be put right. Let™s examine the facts.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        There™s magic, positive magic, in such phrases as: "I may be wrong. I frequently am. Let™s
                        examine the facts.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>Nobody in the heavens above or on earth beneath or in the waters under the earth will ever object
                        to your saying: "I may be wrong. Let™s examine the facts.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        One of our class members who used this approach in dealing with customers was Harold Reinke, a
                        Dodge dealer in Billings, Montana. He reported that because of the pressures of the automobile
                        business, he was often hard-boiled and callous when dealing with customers™ complaints. This
                        caused flared tempers, loss of business and general unpleasantness.</p>
                    <p>
                        He told his class: ﬁRecognizing that this was getting me nowhere fast, I tried a new tack. I
                        would say something like this: ‚Our dealership has made so many mistakes that I am frequently
                        ashamed. We may have erred in your case. Tell me about it.™</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁThis approach becomes quite disarming, and by the time the customer releases his feelings, he
                        is usually much more reasonable when it comes to settling the matter. In fact, several customers
                        have thanked me for having such an understanding attitude. And two of them have even brought in
                        friends to buy new cars. In this highly competitive market, we need more of this type of
                        customer, and I believe 119</p>
                    <p>that showing respect for all customers™ opinions and treating them diplomatically and courteously
                        will help beat the competition.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        You will never get into trouble by admitting that you may be wrong. That will stop all argument
                        and inspire your opponent to be just as fair and open and broad-minded as you are. It will make
                        him want to admit that he, too, may be wrong.</p>
                    <p>
                        If you know positively that a person is wrong, and you bluntly tell him or her so, what happens?
                        Let me illustrate. Mr. S---- a young New York attorney, once argued a rather important case
                        before the United States Supreme Court (Lustgarten v. Fleet Corporation 280 U.S. 320). The case
                        involved a considerable sum of money and an important question of law. During the argument, one
                        of the Supreme Court justices said to him: ﬁThe statute of limitations in admiralty law is six
                        years, is it not?ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        Mr. S---- stopped, stared at the Justice for a moment, and then said bluntly: ﬁYour Honor, there
                        is no statute of limitations in admiralty.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        "A hush fell on the court,ﬂ said Mr. S---- as he related his experience to one of the author™s
                        classes, ﬁand the temperature in the room seemed to drop to zero. I was right. Justice - was
                        wrong. And I had told him so. But did that make him friendly? No. I still believe that I had the
                        law on my side. And I know that I spoke better than I ever spoke before. But I didn™t persuade.
                        I made the enormous blunder of telling a very learned and famous man that he was wrong.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        Few people are logical. Most of us are prejudiced and biased. Most of us are blighted with
                        preconceived notions, with jealousy, suspicion, fear, envy and pride. And most citizens don™t
                        want to change their minds about their religion or their haircut or communism or their favorite
                        movie star. So, if you are inclined to tell people they are wrong, please read the following
                        paragraph every morning before breakfast. It is from James Harvey Robinson™s enlightening book
                        The Mind in the Making.</p>
                    <p>
                        We sometimes find ourselves changing our minds without any resistance or heavy emotion, but if
                        we are told we are wrong, we resent the imputation and harden our hearts. We are incredibly
                        heedless in the formation of our beliefs, but find ourselves filled with an illicit passion for
                        them when anyone proposes to rob us of their companionship. It is obviously not the ideas
                        themselves that are dear to us, but our self-esteem which is threatened. . . . The little word
                        ﬁmyﬂ is the most important one in human affairs, and properly to reckon with it is the beginning
                        of wisdom. It has 120</p>
                    <p>the same force whether it is ﬁmyﬂ dinner, ﬁmyﬂ dog, and "my" house, or ﬁmyﬂ father, ﬁmyﬂ country,
                        and ﬁmyﬂ God. We not only resent the imputation that our watch is wrong, or our car shabby, but
                        that our conception of the canals of Mars, of the pronunciation of ﬁEpictetus,ﬂ of the medicinal
                        value of salicin, or of the date of Sargon I is subject to revision. We like to continue to
                        believe what we have been accustomed to accept as true, and the resentment aroused when doubt is
                        cast upon any of our assumptions leads us to seek every manner of excuse for clinging to it. The
                        result is that most of our so-called reasoning consists in finding arguments for going on
                        believing as we already do.</p>
                    <p>
                        Carl Rogers, the eminent psychologist, wrote in his book On Becoming a Person:</p>
                    <p>
                        I have found it of enormous value when I can permit myself to understand the other person. The
                        way in which I have worded this statement may seem strange to you, Is it necessary to permit
                        oneself to understand another? I think it is. Our first reaction to most of the statements
                        (which we hear from other people) is an evaluation or judgment, rather than an understanding of
                        it. When someone expresses some feeling, attitude or belief, our tendency is almost immediately
                        to feel ﬁthat™s right,ﬂ or ﬁthat™s stupid,ﬂ ﬁthat™s abnormal,ﬂ ﬁthat™s unreasonable,ﬂ ﬁthat™s
                        incorrect,ﬂ ﬁthat™s not nice ." Very rarely do we permit ourselves to understand precisely what
                        the meaning of the statement is to the other person.</p>
                    <p>
                        I once employed an interior decorator to make some draperies for my home. When the bill arrived,
                        I was dismayed.</p>
                    <p>
                        A few days later, a friend dropped in and looked at the draperies. The price was mentioned, and
                        she exclaimed with a note of triumph: ﬁWhat? That™s awful. I am afraid he put one over on
                        you.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        True? Yes, she had told the truth, but few people like to listen to truths that reflect on their
                        judgment. So, being human, I tried to defend myself. I pointed out that the best is eventually
                        the cheapest, that one can™t expect to get quality and artistic taste at bargain-basement
                        prices, and so on and on.</p>
                    <p>
                        The next day another friend dropped in, admired the draperies, bubbled over with enthusiasm, and
                        expressed a wish that she could afford such exquisite creations for her home. My reaction was
                        totally different. ﬁWell, to tell the truth,ﬂ I said, "I can™t afford them myself. I paid too
                        much. I™m sorry I ordered them,ﬂ</p>
                    <p>121</p>
                    <p>When we are wrong, we may admit it to ourselves. And if we are handled gently and tactfully, we
                        may admit it to others and even take pride in our frankness and broad-mindedness. But not if
                        someone else is trying to ram the unpalatable fact down our esophagus.</p>
                    <p>
                        Horace Greeley, the most famous editor in America during the time of the Civil War, disagreed
                        violently with Lincoln™s policies. He believed that he could drive Lincoln into agreeing with
                        him by a campaign of argument, ridicule and abuse. He waged this bitter campaign month after
                        month, year after year. In fact, he wrote a brutal, bitter, sarcastic and personal attack on
                        President Lincoln the night Booth shot him.</p>
                    <p>But did all this bitterness make Lincoln agree with Greeley? Not at all. Ridicule and abuse never
                        do. If you want some excellent suggestions about dealing with people and managing yourself and
                        improving your personality, read Benjamin Franklin™s autobiography - one of the most fascinating
                        life stories ever written, one of the classics of American literature. Ben Franklin tells how he
                        conquered the iniquitous habit of argument and transformed himself into one of the most able,
                        suave and diplomatic men in American history.</p>
                    <p>
                        One day, when Ben Franklin was a blundering youth, an old Quaker friend took him aside and
                        lashed him with a few stinging truths, something like this:</p>
                    <p>
                        Ben, you are impossible. Your opinions have a slap in them for everyone who differs with you.
                        They have become so offensive that nobody cares for them. Your friends find they enjoy
                        themselves better when you are not around. You know so much that no man can tell you anything.
                        Indeed, no man is going to try, for the effort would lead only to discomfort and hard work. So
                        you are not likely ever to know any more than you do now, which is very little.</p>
                    <p>
                        One of the finest things I know about Ben Franklin is the way he accepted that smarting rebuke.
                        He was big enough and wise enough to realize that it was true, to sense that he was headed for
                        failure and social disaster. So he made a right-about-face. He began immediately to change his
                        insolent, opinionated ways.</p>
                    <p>
                        "I made it a rule,ﬂ said Franklin, ﬁto forbear all direct contradiction to the sentiment of
                        others, and all positive assertion of my own, I even forbade myself the use of every word or
                        expression in the language that imported a fix™d opinion, such as ‚certainly,™ ‚undoubtedly,™
                        etc., and I adopted, instead of them, ‚I conceive,™ ‚I 122</p>
                    <p>apprehend,™ or ‚I imagine™ a thing to be so or so, or ‚it so appears to me at present.™ When
                        another asserted something that I thought an error, I deny™d myself the pleasure of
                        contradicting him abruptly, and of showing immediately some absurdity in his proposition: and in
                        answering I began by observing that in certain cases or circumstances his opinion would be
                        right, but in the present case there appear™d or seem™d to me some difference, etc. I soon found
                        the advantage of this change in my manner; the conversations I engag™d in went on more
                        pleasantly. The modest way in which I propos™d my opinions procur'd them a readier reception and
                        less contradiction; I had less mortification when I was found to be in the wrong, and I more
                        easily prevaile'd with others to give up their mistakes and join with me when I happened to be
                        in the right.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁAnd this mode, which I at first put on with some violence to natural inclination, became at
                        length so easy, and so habitual to me, that perhaps for these fifty years past no one has ever
                        heard a dogmatical expression escape me. And to this habit (after my character of integrity) I
                        think it principally owing that I had earned so much weight with my fellow citizens when I
                        proposed new institutions, or alterations in the old, and so much influence in public councils
                        when I became a member; for I was but a bad speaker, never eloquent, subject to much hesitation
                        in my choice of words, hardly correct in language, and yet I generally carried my points.ﬂ</p>

                        How do Ben Franklin™s methods work in business? Let™s take two examples.</p>
                    <p>Katherine A, Allred of Kings Mountain, North Carolina, is an industrial engineering supervisor
                        for a yarn-processing plant. She told one of our classes how she handled a sensitive problem
                        before and after taking our training:</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁPart of my responsibility,ﬂ she reported, ﬁdeals with setting up and maintaining incentive
                        systems and standards for our operators so they can make more money by producing more yarn. The
                        system we were using had worked fine when we had only two or three different types of yarn, but
                        recently we had expanded our inventory and capabilities to enable us to run more than twelve
                        different varieties. The present system was no longer adequate to pay the operators fairly for
                        the work being performed and give them an incentive to increase</p>
                    <p>production. I had worked up a new system which would enable us to pay the operator by the class
                        of yam she was running at any one particular time. With my new system in hand, I entered the
                        meeting determined to prove to the management that my system was the right approach. I told them
                        in detail how they were wrong and showed where they were 123</p>
                    <p>being unfair and how I had all the answers they needed. To say the least, I failed miserably! I
                        had become so busy defending my position on the new system that I had left them no opening to
                        graciously admit their problems on the old one. The issue was dead.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁAfter several sessions of this course, I realized all too well where I had made my mistakes. I
                        called another meeting and this time I asked where they felt their problems were. We discussed
                        each point, and I asked them their opinions on which was the best way to proceed.</p>
                    <p>
                        With a few low-keyed suggestions, at proper intervals, I let them develop my system themselves.
                        At the end of the meeting when I actually presented my system, they enthusiastically accepted
                        it.</p>
                    <p>
                        "I am convinced now that nothing good is accomplished and a lot of damage can be done if you
                        tell a person straight out that he or she is wrong. You only succeed in stripping that person of
                        self-dignity and making yourself an unwelcome part of any discussion.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        Let™s take another example - and remember these cases I am citing are typical of the experiences
                        of thousands of other people. R. V. Crowley was a salesman for a lumber company in New York.
                        Crowley admitted that he had been telling hard-boiled lumber inspectors for years that they were
                        wrong. And he had won the arguments too. But it hadn™t done any good. ﬁFor these lumber
                        inspectors,ﬂ said Mr. Crowley, "are like baseball umpires. Once they make a decision, they never
                        change it,ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        Mr. Crowley saw that his firm was losing thousands of dollars through the arguments he won. So
                        while taking my course, he resolved to change tactics and abandon arguments. With what results?
                        Here is the story as he told it to the fellow members of his class:</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁOne morning the phone rang in my office. A hot and bothered person at the other end proceeded
                        to inform me that a car of lumber we had shipped into his plant was entirely unsatisfactory. His
                        firm had stopped unloading and requested that we make immediate arrangements to remove the stock
                        from their yard. After about one-fourth of the car had been unloaded, their lumber inspector
                        reported that the lumber was running 55 percent below grade. Under the circumstances, they
                        refused to accept it. 124</p>
                    <p>
                        "I immediately started for his plant and on the way turned over in my mind the best way to
                        handle the situation. Ordinarily, under such circumstances, I should have quoted grading rules
                        and tried, as a result of my own experience and knowledge as a lumber inspector, to convince the
                        other inspector that the lumber was actually up to grade, and that he was misinterpreting the
                        rules in his inspection. However, I thought I would apply the principles learned in this
                        training.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁWhen I arrived at the plant, I found the purchasing agent and the lumber inspector in a wicked
                        humor, both set for an argument and a fight. We walked out to the car that was being unloaded,
                        and I requested that they continue to unload so that I could see how things were going. I asked
                        the inspector to go right ahead and lay out the rejects, as he had been doing, and to put the
                        good pieces in another pile.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁAfter watching him for a while it began to dawn on me that his inspection actually was much too
                        strict and that he was misinterpreting the rules. This particular lumber was white pine, and I
                        knew the inspector was thoroughly schooled in hard woods but not a competent, experienced
                        inspector on white pine. White pine happened to be my own strong suit, but did I offer any
                        objection to the way he was grading the lumber? None whatever. I kept on watching and gradually
                        began to ask questions as to why certain pieces were not satisfactory.</p>
                    <p>I didn™t for one instant insinuate that the inspector was wrong. I emphasized that my only reason
                        for asking was in order that we could give his firm exactly what they wanted in future
                        shipments. wanted in future shipments.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁBy asking questions in a very friendly, cooperative spirit, and insisting continually that they
                        were right in laying out boards not satisfactory to their purpose, I got</p>
                    <p>him warmed up, and the strained relations between us began to thaw and melt away. An occasional
                        carefully put remark on my part gave birth to the idea in his mind that possibly some of these
                        rejected pieces were actually within the grade that they had bought, and that their requirements
                        demanded a more expensive grade. I was very careful, however, not to let him think I was making
                        an issue of this point.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁGradually his whole attitude changed. He finally admitted to me that he was not experienced on
                        white pine and began to ask me questions about each piece as it came out of the car, I would
                        explain why such a piece came within the grade specified, but kept on insisting that we did not
                        want him to take it if it was unsuitable for their purpose. He finally got to the point where he
                        felt guilty every time he put a piece in the rejected pile. And at last he saw that the mistake
                        was on 125</p>
                    <p>their part for not having specified as good a grade as they needed.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁThe ultimate outcome was that he went through the entire carload again after I left, accepted
                        the whole lot, and we received a check in full.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁIn that one instance alone, a little tact, and the determination to refrain from telling the
                        other man he was wrong, saved my company a substantial amount of cash, and it would be hard to
                        place a money value on the good will that was saved.ﬂ</p>

                        Martin Luther King was asked how, as a pacifist, he could be an admirer of Air Force General
                        Daniel "Chappieﬂ James, then the nation™s highest-ranking black officer. Dr. King replied, "I

                        In a similar way, General Robert E. Lee once spoke to the president of the Confederacy,
                        Jefferson Davis, in the most glowing terms about a certain officer under his command. Another
                        officer in attendance was astonished. ﬁGeneral,ﬂ he said, " do you not know that the man of whom
                        you speak so highly is one of your bitterest enemies who misses no opportunity to malign you?ﬂ
                        "Yes," replied General Lee, ﬁbut the president asked my opinion of him; he did not ask for his
                        opinion of me.ﬂ</p>

                        By the way, I am not revealing anything new in this chapter. Two thousand years ago, Jesus said:

                        And 2,200 years before Christ was born, King Akhtoi of Egypt gave his son some shrewd advice -
                        advice that is sorely needed today. ﬁBe diplomatic,ﬂ counseled the King. ﬁIt will help you gain
                        your point.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        In other words, don™t argue with your customer or your spouse or your adversary. Don™t tell them
                        they are wrong, don™t get them stirred up. Use a little diplomacy.</p>

                    <p>3 - IF YOU™RE WRONG, ADMIT IT</p>
                    <p>
                        Within a minute™s walk of my house there was a wild stretch of virgin timber, where the
                        blackberry thickets foamed white in the springtime, where the squirrels nested and reared their
                        young, and the horseweeds grew as tall as a horse™s head. This unspoiled woodland was called
                        Forest Park - and it was a forest, probably not much different in appearance from what it was
                        when Columbus discovered America. I frequently walked in this park with Rex, my little Boston
                        bulldog. He was a friendly, harmless little hound; and since we rarely met anyone in the park, I
                        took Rex along without a leash or a muzzle.</p>
                    <p>
                        One day we encountered a mounted policeman in the park, a policeman itching to show his
                        authority.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁ‚What do you mean by letting that dog run loose in the park without a muzzle and leash?ﬂ he
                        reprimanded me. ﬁDon™t you know it™s against the law?ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁYes, I know it is,ﬂ I replied softy, ﬁbut I didn™t think he would do any harm out here.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        "You didn™t think! You didn™t think! The law doesn™t give a tinker™s damn about what you think.
                        That dog might kill a squirrel or bite a child. Now, I™m going to let you off this time; but if
                        I catch this dog out here again without a muzzle and a leash, you™ll have to tell it to the
                        judge ."</p>
                    <p>
                        I meekly promised to obey.</p>
                    <p>
                        And I did obey - for a few times. But Rex didn™t like the muzzle, and neither did I; so we
                        decided to take a chance. Everything was lovely for a while, and then we struck a snag. Rex and
                        I raced over the brow of a hill one afternoon and there, suddenly - to my dismay - I saw the
                        majesty of the law, astride a bay horse. Rex was out in front, heading straight for the
                        officer.</p>
                    <p>
                        I was in for it. I knew it. So I didn™t wait until the policeman started talking. I beat him to
                        it. I said: ﬁOfficer, you™ve caught me red-handed. I™m guilty. I have no alibis, no excuses. You
                        warned me last week that if I brought the dog out here again without a muzzle you would fine
                        me.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>"Well, now,ﬂ the policeman responded in a soft tone. ﬁI know it™s a temptation to let 127</p>
                    <p>a little dog like that have a run out here when nobody is around.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁSure it™s a temptation,ﬂ I replied, ﬁbut it is against the law.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁWell, a little dog like that isn™t going to harm anybody,ﬂ the policeman remonstrated.</p>
                    <p>
                        "No, but he may kill squirrels,ﬂ I said.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁWell now, I think you are taking this a bit too seriously,ﬂ he told me. ﬁI™ll tell you what you
                        do. You just let him run over the hill there where I can™t see him - and we™ll forget all about
                        it.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        That policeman, being human, wanted a feeling of importance; so when I began to condemn myself,
                        the only way he could nourish his self-esteem was to take the magnanimous attitude of showing
                        mercy.</p>
                    <p>
                        But suppose I had tried to defend myself - well, did you ever argue with a policeman?</p>
                    <p>
                        But instead of breaking lances with him, I admitted that he was absolutely right and I was
                        absolutely wrong; I admitted it quickly, openly, and with enthusiasm. The affair terminated
                        graciously in my taking his side and his taking my side. Lord Chesterfield himself could hardly
                        have been more gracious than this mounted policeman, who, only a week previously, had threatened
                        to have the law on me.</p>
                    <p>
                        If we know we are going to be rebuked anyhow, isn™t it far better to beat the other person to it
                        and do it ourselves? Isn™t it much easier to listen to self-criticism than to bear condemnation
                        from alien lips?</p>
                    <p>
                        Say about yourself all the derogatory things you know the other person is thinking or wants to
                        say or intends to say - and say them before that person has a chance to say them. The chances
                        are a hundred to one that a generous, forgiving attitude will be taken and your mistakes will be
                        minimized just as the mounted policeman did with me and Rex.</p>

                        Ferdinand E. Warren, a commercial artist, used this technique to win the good will of a
                        petulant, scolding buyer of art.</p>

                    <p>ﬁIt is important, in making drawings for advertising and publishing purposes, to be precise and
                        very exact,ﬂ Mr. Warren said as he told the story.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁSome art editors demand that their commissions be executed immediately; and in these cases,
                        some slight error is liable to occur. I knew one art director in particular who was always
                        delighted to find fault with some little thing. I have often left his office in disgust, not
                        because of the criticism, but because of his method of attack. Recently I delivered a rush job
                        to this editor, and he phoned me to call at his office immediately. He said something was wrong.
                        When I arrived, I found just what I had anticipated - and dreaded. He was hostile, gloating over
                        his chance to criticize. He demanded with heat why I had done so and so. My opportunity had come
                        to apply the self-criticism I had been studying about. So I said: ''Mr. So-and-so, if what you
                        say is true, I am at fault and there is absolutely no excuse for my blunder. I have been doing
                        drawings for you long enough to know better. I™m ashamed of myself.™</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁImmediately he started to defend me. ‚Yes, you™re right, but after all, this isn™t a serious
                        mistake. It is only...'</p>
                    <p>
                        "I interrupted him. ‚Any mistake,™ I said, ‚may be costly and they are all irritating.™</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁHe started to break in, but I wouldn™t let him. I was having a grand time. For the first time
                        in my life, I was criticizing myself - and I loved it.</p>
                    <p>
                        " ‚I should have been more careful,™ I continued. ‚You give me a lot of work, and you deserve
                        the best; so I™m going to do this drawing all over.™</p>
                    <p>
                        " ‚No! No!™ he protested. ‚I wouldn™t think of putting you to all that trouble.™ He praised my
                        work, assured me that he wanted only a minor change and that my slight error hadn™t cost his
                        firm any money; and, after all, it was a mere detail - not worth worrying about.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁMy eagerness to criticize myself took all the fight out of him. He ended up by taking me to
                        lunch; and before we parted, he gave me a check and another commissionﬂ</p>

                        There is a certain degree of satisfaction in having the courage to admit one™s errors. It not
                        only clears the air of guilt and defensiveness, but often helps solve the problem created by the
                        error.</p>

                    <p>Bruce Harvey of Albuquerque, New Mexico, had incorrectly authorized payment of full wages to an
                        employee on sick leave. When he discovered his error, he brought it to the attention of the
                        employee and explained that to correct the mistake he would have to reduce his next paycheck by
                        the entire amount of the overpayment. The employee pleaded that as that would cause him a
                        serious financial problem, could the money be repaid over a period of time? In order to do this,
                        Harvey explained, he would have to obtain his supervisor's approval. ﬁAnd this I knew,ﬂ reported
                        Harvey, ﬁwould result in a boss-type explosion, While trying to decide how to handle this
                        situation better, I realized that the whole mess was my fault and I would have to admit I it to
                        my boss.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁI walked into his office, told him that I had made a mistake and then informed him of the
                        complete facts. He replied in an explosive manner that it was the fault of the personnel
                        department. I repeated that it was my fault. He exploded again about carelessness in the
                        accounting department. Again I explained it was my fault. He blamed two other people in the
                        office. But each time I reiterated it was my fault. Finally, he looked at me and said, ‚Okay, it
                        was your fault. Now straighten it out.™ The error was corrected and nobody got into trouble. I
                        felt great because I was able to handle a tense situation and had the courage not to seek
                        alibis. My boss has had more respect for me ever since.ﬂ</p>

                        Any fool can try to defend his or her mistakes - and most fools do - but it raises one above the
                        herd and gives one a feeling of nobility and exultation to admit one™s mistakes. For example,
                        one of the most beautiful things that history records about Robert E. Lee is the way he blamed
                        himself and only himself for the failure of Pickett™s charge at Gettysburg.</p>
                    <p>
                        Pickett™s charge was undoubtedly the most brilliant and picturesque attack that ever occurred in
                        the Western world. General George E. Pickett himself was picturesque. He wore his hair so long
                        that his auburn locks almost touched his shoulders; and, like Napoleon in his Italian campaigns,
                        he wrote ardent love-letters almost daily while on the battlefield. His devoted troops cheered
                        him that tragic July afternoon as he rode off jauntily toward the Union lines, his cap set at a
                        rakish angle over his right ear. They cheered and they followed him, man touching man, rank
                        pressing rank, with banners flying and bayonets gleaming in the sun. It was a gallant sight.
                        Daring. Magnificent. A murmur of admiration ran through the Union lines as they beheld it.</p>
                    <p>Pickett™s troops swept forward at any easy trot, through orchard and cornfield, 130</p>
                    <p>across a meadow and over a ravine. All the time, the enemy™s cannon was tearing ghastly holes in
                        their ranks, But on they pressed, grim, irresistible.</p>
                    <p>
                        Suddenly the Union infantry rose from behind the stone wall on Cemetery Ridge where they had
                        been hiding and fired volley after volley into Pickett's onrushing troops. The crest of the hill
                        was a sheet of flame, a slaughterhouse, a blazing volcano. In a few minutes, all of Pickett™s
                        brigade commanders except one were down, and four-fifths of his five thousand men had
                        fallen.</p>
                    <p>
                        General Lewis A. Armistead, leading the troops in the final plunge, ran forward, vaulted over
                        the stone wall, and, waving his cap on the top of his sword, shouted: ﬁGive ‚em the steel,
                        boys!ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        They did. They leaped over the wall, bayoneted their enemies, smashed skulls with clubbed
                        muskets, and planted the battleflags of the South on Cemetery Ridge. The banners waved there
                        only for a moment. But that moment, brief as it was, recorded the high-water mark of the
                        Confederacy.</p>
                    <p>
                        Pickett™s charge - brilliant, heroic - was nevertheless the beginning of the end. Lee had
                        failed. He could not penetrate the North. And he knew it.</p>
                    <p>
                        The South was doomed.</p>
                    <p>Lee was so saddened, so shocked, that he sent in his resignation and asked Jefferson Davis, the
                        president of the Confederacy, to appoint "a younger and abler man.ﬂ If Lee had wanted to blame
                        the disastrous failure of Pickett™s charge on someone else, he could have found a score of
                        alibis. Some of his division commanders had failed him. The cavalry hadn™t arrived in time to
                        support the infantry attack. This had gone wrong and that had gone awry.</p>
                    <p>
                        But Lee was far too noble to blame others. As Pickett™s beaten and bloody troops struggled back
                        to the Confederate lines, Robert E. Lee rode out to meet them all alone and greeted them with a
                        self-condemnation that was little short of sublime. ﬁAll this has been my fault,ﬂ he confessed.

                    <p>

                        Michael Cheung, who teaches our course in Hong Kong, told of how the Chinese culture presents
                        some special problems and how sometimes it is necessary to 131</p>
                    <p>recognize that the benefit of applying a principle may be more advantageous than maintaining an
                        old tradition.</p>

                        He had one middle-aged class member who had been estranged from his son for many years. The
                        father had been an opium addict, but was now cured. In Chinese tradition an older person cannot
                        take the first step. The father felt that it was up to his son to take the initiative toward a
                        reconciliation. In an early session, he told the class about the grandchildren he had never seen
                        and how much he desired to be reunited with his son. His classmates, all Chinese, understood his
                        conflict between his desire and long-established tradition. The father felt that young people
                        should have respect for their elders and that he was right in not giving in to his desire, but
                        to wait for hi</p>
                    <p>son to come to him.</p>
                    <p>
                        Toward the end of the course the father again addressed his class. ﬁI have pondered this
                        problem,ﬂ he said. ﬁDale Carnegie says, ‚If you are wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically.™
                        It is too late for me to admit it quickly, but I can admit it emphatically. I wronged my son. He
                        was right in not wanting to see me and to expel me from his life. I may lose face by asking a
                        younger person™s forgiveness, but I was at fault and it is my responsibility to admit this.ﬂ The
                        class applauded and gave him their full support. At the next class he told how he went to his
                        son™s house, asked for and received forgiveness and was now embarked on a new relationship with
                        his son, his daughter-in-law and the grandchildren he had at last met.</p>

                        Elbert Hubbard was one of the most original authors who ever stirred up a nation, and his

                    <p>Nobody appreciated the truth of Woodrow Wilson™s statement more than John D. Rockefeller, Jr.
                        Back in 1915, Rockefeller was the most fiercely despised man in Colorado, One of the bloodiest
                        strikes in the history of American industry had been shocking the state for two terrible years.
                        Irate, belligerent miners were demanding higher wages from the Colorado Fuel and Iron Company;
                        Rockefeller controlled that company. Property had</p>
                    <p>been destroyed, troops had been called out. Blood had been shed. Strikers had been shot, their
                        bodies riddled with bullets.</p>
                    <p>
                        At a time like that, with the air seething with hatred, Rockefeller wanted to win the strikers
                        to his way of thinking. And he did it. How? Here™s the story. After weeks spent in making
                        friends, Rockefeller addressed the representatives of the strikers. This speech, in its
                        entirety, is a masterpiece. It produced astonishing results. It calmed the tempestuous waves of
                        hate that threatened to engulf Rockefeller. It won him a host of admirers. It presented facts in
                        such a friendly manner that the strikers went back to work without saying another word about the
                        increase in wages for which they had fought so violently.</p>
                    <p>
                        The opening of that remarkable speech follows. Note how it fairly glows with friendliness.
                        Rockefeller, remember, was talking to men who, a few days previously, had wanted to hang him by
                        the neck to a sour apple tree; yet he couldn™t have been more gracious, more friendly if he had
                        addressed a group of medical missionaries. His speech was radiant with such phrases as I am
                        proud to be here, having visited in your homes, met many of your wives and children, we meet

                    <p>
                        ﬁThis is a red-letter day in my life,ﬂ Rockefeller began. ﬁIt is the first time I have ever had
                        the good fortune to meet the representatives of the employees of this great company, its
                        officers and superintendents, together, and I can assure you that I am proud to be here, and
                        that I shall remember this gathering as long as I live. Had this meeting been held two weeks
                        ago, I should have stood here a stranger to most of you, recognizing a few faces. Having had the
                        opportunity last week of visiting all the camps in the southern coal field and of talking
                        individually with practically all of the representatives, except those who were away; having
                        visited in your homes, met many of your wives and children, we meet here not as strangers, but
                        as friends, and it is in that spirit of mutual friendship that I am glad to have this
                        opportunity to discuss with you our common interests.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁSince this is a meeting of the officers of the company and the representatives of the
                        employees, it is only by your courtesy that I am here, for I am not so fortunate as to be either
                        one or the other; and yet I feel that I am intimately associated with you men, for, in a sense,
                        I represent both the stockholders and the directors.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        Isn™t that a superb example of the fine art of making friends out of enemies?</p>
                    <p>
                        Suppose Rockefeller had taken a different tack. Suppose he had argued with those miners and
                        hurled devastating facts in their faces. Suppose he had told them by his tones and insinuations
                        that they were wrong Suppose that, by all the rules of logic, he had proved that they were
                        wrong. What would have happened? More anger would have been stirred up, more hatred, more
                        revolt.</p>
                    <p>
                        If a man's heart is rankling with discord and ill feeling toward you, you can™t win him to your
                        way of thinking with all the logic in Christendom. Scolding parents and domineering bosses and
                        husbands and nagging wives ought to realize that people don™t want to change their minds. They
                        can™t he forced or driven to agree with you or me. But they may possibly be led to, if we are
                        gentle and friendly, ever so gentle and ever so friendly.</p>
                    <p>
                        Lincoln said that, in effect, over a hundred years ago. Here are his words:</p>
                    <p>
                        It is an old and true maxim that "a drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall." So
                        with men, if you would win a man to you cause, first convince him that you are his sincere
                        friend. Therein is a drop of honey that catches his heart; which, 135</p>
                    <p>say what you will, is the great high road to his reason.</p>
                    <p>Business executives have learned that it pays to be friendly to strikers. For example, when 2,500
                        employees in the White Motor Company™s plant struck for higher wages and a union shop, Robert F.
                        Black, then president of the company, didn™t lose his temper and condemn and threaten and talk
                        of tryanny and Communists. He actually praised the strikers. He published an advertisement in
                        the Cleveland papers, complimenting them on ﬁthe peaceful way in which they laid down their
                        tools.ﬂ Finding the strike pickets idle, he bought them a couple of dozen baseball bats and
                        gloves and invited them to play ball on vacant lots. For those who preferred bowling, he rented
                        a bowling alley.</p>
                    <p>
                        This friendliness on Mr. Black™s part did what friendliness always does: it begot friendliness.
                        So the strikers borrowed brooms, shovels, and rubbish carts, and began picking up matches,
                        papers, cigarette stubs, and cigar butts around the factory. Imagine it! Imagine strikers
                        tidying up the factory grounds while battling for higher wages and recognition of the union.
                        Such an event had never been heard of before in the long, tempestuous history of American labor
                        wars. That strike ended with a compromise settlement within a week-ended without any ill feeling
                        or rancor.</p>
                    <p>
                        Daniel Webster, who looked like a god and talked like Jehovah, was one of the most successful
                        advocates who ever pleaded a case; yet he ushered in his most powerful arguments with such
                        friendly remarks as: ﬁIt will be for the jury to consider,ﬂ ﬁThis may perhaps be worth thinking
                        of,ﬂ " Here are some facts that I trust you will not lose sight of,ﬂ or ﬁYou, with your
                        knowledge of human nature, will easily see the significance of these facts.ﬂ No bulldozing. No
                        high-pressure methods. No attempt to force his opinions on others. Webster used the soft-spoken,
                        quiet, friendly approach, and it helped to make him famous.</p>
                    <p>
                        You may never be called upon to settle a strike or address a jury, but you may want to get your
                        rent reduced. Will the friendly approach help you then? Let™s see.</p>
                    <p>
                        O. L. Straub, an engineer, wanted to get his rent reduced. And he knew his landlord was
                        hard-boiled. "I wrote him,ﬂ Mr. Straub said in a speech before the class, ﬁnotifying him that I
                        was vacating my apartment as soon as my lease expired. The truth was, I didn™t want to move. I
                        wanted to stay if I could get my rent reduced. But the situation seemed hopeless. Other tenants
                        had tried - and failed. Everyone told me that the landlord was extremely difficult to deal with.
                        But I said to myself, ‚I am studying a course in how to deal with people, so 136</p>
                    <p>I™ll try it on him - and see how it works.™</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁHe and his secretary came to see me as soon as he got my letter. I met him at the door with a
                        friendly greeting. I fairly bubbled with good will and enthusiasm. I didn™t begin talking about
                        how high the rent was. I began talking about how much I liked his apartment house. Believe me, I
                        was ‚hearty in my approbation and lavish in my praise.' I complimented him on the way he ran the
                        building and told him I should like so much to stay for another year but I couldn™t afford
                        it.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁHe had evidently never had such a reception from a tenant. He hardly knew what to make of
                        it.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁThen he started to tell me his troubles. Complaining tenants. One had written him fourteen
                        letters, some of them positively insulting. Another threatened to break his lease unless the
                        landlord kept the man on the floor above from snoring. ‚What a relief it is,™ he said, ‚to have
                        a satisfied tenant like you.™ And then, without my even asking him to do it, he offered to
                        reduce my rent a little. I wanted more, so I named the figure I could afford to pay, and he
                        accepted without a word.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁAs he was leaving, he turned to me and asked, ‚What decorating can I do for you?™</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁIf I had tried to get the rent reduced by the methods the other tenants were using, I am
                        positive I should have met with the same failure they encountered. It was the friendly,
                        sympathetic, appreciative approach that won.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        Dean Woodcock of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, is the superintendent of a department of the local
                        electric company. His staff was called upon to repair some equipment on top of a pole. This type
                        of work had formerly been performed by a different department and had only recently been
                        transferred to Woodcock™s section Although his people had been trained in the work, this was the
                        first time they had ever actually been called upon to do it. Everybody in the organization was
                        interested in seeing if and how they could handle it. Mr. Woodcock, several of his subordinate
                        managers, and members of other departments of the utility went to see the operation. Many cars
                        and trucks were there, and a number of people were standing around watching the two lone men on
                        top of the pole.</p>
                    <p>
                        Glancing around, Woodcock noticed a man up the street getting out of his car with a camera. He
                        began taking pictures of the scene. Utility people are extremely conscious of public relations,
                        and suddenly Woodcock realized what this setup 137</p>
                    <p>looked like to the man with the camera - overkill, dozens of people being called out to do a
                        two-person job. He strolled up the street to the photographer.</p>
                    <p>
                        "I see you™re interested in our operation.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁYes, and my mother will be more than interested. She owns stock in your company. This will be
                        an eye-opener for her. She may even decide her investment was unwise. I™ve been telling her for
                        years there™s a lot of waste motion in companies like yours. This proves it. The newspapers
                        might like these pictures, too.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁIt does look like it, doesn™t it? I™d think the same thing in your position. But this is a
                        unique situation, . . .ﬂ and Dean Woodcock went on to explain how this was the first job of this
                        type for his department and how everybody from executives down was interested. He assured the
                        man that under normal conditions two people could handle the job. The photographer put away his
                        camera, shook Woodcock™s hand, and thanked him for taking the time to explain the situation to
                        him.</p>
                    <p>
                        Dean Woodcock™s friendly approach saved his company much embarrassment and bad publicity.</p>
                    <p>
                        Another member of one of our classes, Gerald H. Winn of Littleton, New Hampshire, reported how
                        by using a friendly approach, he obtained a very satisfactory settlement on a damage claim.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁEarly in the spring,ﬂ he reported, ﬁbefore the ground had thawed from the winter freezing,
                        there was an unusually heavy rainstorm and the water, which normally would have run off to
                        nearby ditches and storm drains along the road, took a new course onto a building lot where I
                        had just built a new home.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁNot being able to run off, the water pressure built up around the foundation of the house. The
                        water forced itself under the concrete basement floor, causing it to explode, and the basement
                        filled with water. This ruined the furnace and the hot-water heater. The cost to repair this
                        damage was in excess of two thousand dollars. I had no insurance to cover this type of
                        damage.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁHowever, I soon found out that the owner of the subdivision had neglected to put in a storm
                        drain near the house which could have prevented this problem I made an appointment to see him.
                        During the twenty-five-mile trip to his office, I carefully 138</p>
                    <p>reviewed the situation and, remembering the principles I learned in this course, I decided that
                        showing my anger would not serve any worthwhile purpose, When I arrived, I kept very calm and
                        started by talking about his recent vacation to the West Indies; then, when I felt the timing
                        was right, I mentioned the ‚little™ problem of water damage. He quickly agreed to do his share
                        in helping to correct the problem.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁA few days later he called and said he would pay for the damage and also put in a storm drain
                        to prevent the same thing from happening in the future.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁEven though it was the fault of the owner of the subdivision, if I had not begun in a friendly
                        way, there would have been a great deal of difficulty in getting him to agree to the total
                        liability.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        Years ago, when I was a barefoot boy walking through the woods to a country school out in
                        northwest Missouri, I read a fable about the sun and the wind. They quarreled about which was
                        the stronger, and the wind said, "I'll prove I am. See the old man down there with a coat? I bet
                        I can get his coat off him quicker than you can.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>So the sun went behind a cloud, and the wind blew until it was almost a tornado, but the harder
                        it blew, the tighter the old man clutched his coat to him.</p>
                    <p>Finally, the wind calmed down and gave up, and then the sun came out from behind the clouds and
                        smiled kindly on the old man. Presently, he mopped his brow and pulled off his coat. The sun
                        then told the wind that gentleness and friendliness were always stronger than fury and
                        force.</p>
                    <p>
                        The use of gentleness and friendliness is demonstrated day after day by people who have learned
                        that a drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall. F. Gale Connor of Lutherville,
                        Maryland, proved this when he had to take his four-month-old car to the service department of
                        the car dealer for the third time. He told our class: ﬁIt was apparent that talking to,
                        reasoning with or shouting at the service manager was not going to lead to a satisfactory
                        resolution of my problems.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁI walked over to the showroom and asked to see the agency owner, Mr. White. After a short wait,
                        I was ushered into Mr. White™s office. I introduced myself and explained to him that I had
                        bought my car from his dealership because of the recommendations of friends who had had previous
                        dealings with him. I was told 139</p>
                    <p>that his prices were very competitive and his service was outstanding. He smiled with
                        satisfaction as he listened to me. I then explained the problem I was having with the service
                        department. ‚I thought you might want to be aware of any situation that might tarnish your fine
                        reputation,™ I added. He thanked me for calling this to his attention and assured me that my
                        problem would be taken care of. Not only did he personal get involved, but he also lent me his
                        car to use while mine was being repaired.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        Aesop was a Greek slave who lived at the court of Croesus and spun immortal fables six hundred
                        years before Christ. Yet the truths he taught about human nature are just as true in Boston and
                        Birmingham now as they were twenty-six centuries ago in Athens. The sun can make you take off
                        your coat more quickly than the wind; and kindliness, the friendly approach and appreciation can
                        make people change their minds more readily than all the bluster and storming in the world.</p>

                        In talking with people, don™t begin by discussing the things on which you differ. Begin by
                        emphasizingŠand keep on emphasizingŠthe things on which you agree. Keep emphasizing, if
                        possible, that you are both striving for the same end and that your only difference is one of
                        method and not of purpose.</p>
                    <p>
                        Get the other person saying ﬁYes, yesﬂ at the outset. Keep your opponent, if possible, from
                        saying ﬁNo.ﬂ A ﬁNoﬂ response, according to Professor Overstreet, is a most difficult handicap to
                        overcome. When you have said ﬁNo,ﬂ all your pride of personality demands that you remain
                        consistent with yourself. You may later feel that the ﬁNoﬂ was ill-advised; nevertheless, there
                        is your precious pride to consider! Once having said a thing, you feel you must stick to it.
                        Hence it is of the very greatest importance that a person be started in the affirmative
                        direction.</p>
                    <p>
                        The skillful speaker gets, at the outset, a number of ﬁYesﬂ responses. This sets the
                        psychological process of the listeners moving in the affirmative direction. It is like the
                        movement of a billiard ball. Propel in one direction, and it takes some force to deflect it; far
                        more force to send it back in the opposite direction.</p>
                    <p>
                        The psychological patterns here are quite clear. When a person says ﬁNoﬂ and really means it, he
                        or she is doing far more than saying a word of two letters. The entire organismŠglandular,
                        nervous, muscularŠgathers itself together into a condition of rejection. There is, usually in
                        minute but sometimes in observable degree, a physical withdrawal or readiness for withdrawal.
                        The whole neuromuscular system, in short, sets itself on guard against acceptance. When, to the
                        contrary, a person says ﬁYes,ﬂ none of the withdrawal activities takes place. The organism is in
                        a forward - moving, accepting, open attitude. Hence the more ﬁYesesﬂ we can, at the very outset,
                        induce, the more likely we are to succeed in capturing the attention for our ultimate
                        proposal.</p>
                    <p>
                        It is a very simple technique - this yes response. And yet, how much it is neglected! It often
                        seems as if people get a sense of their own importance by antagonizing others at the outset.</p>
                    <p>
                        Get a student to say ﬁNoﬂ at the beginning, or a customer, child, husband, or wife, and it takes
                        the wisdom and the patience of angels to transform that bristling negative into an affirmative.
                        141</p>
                    <p>
                        The use of this ﬁyes, yesﬂ technique enabled James Eberson, who was a teller in the Greenwich
                        Savings Bank, in New York City, to secure a prospective customer who might otherwise have been
                        lost.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁThis man came in to open an account,ﬂ said Mr. Eberson, ﬁand I gave him our usual form to fill
                        out. Some of the questions he answered willingly, but there were others he flatly refused to
                        answer.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁBefore I began the study of human relations, I would have told this prospective depositor that
                        if he refused to give the bank this information, we should have to refuse to accept this
                        account. I am ashamed that I have been guilty of doing that very thing in the past. Naturally,
                        an ultimatum like that made me feel good. I had shown who was boss, that the bank™s rules and
                        regulations couldn™t be flouted. But that sort of attitude certainly didn™t give a feeling of
                        welcome and importance to the man who had walked in to give us his patronage.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁI resolved this morning to use a little horse sense. I resolved not to talk about what the bank
                        wanted but about what the customer wanted. And above all else, I was determined to get him
                        saying ‚yes, yes™ from the very start. So I agreed with him. I told him the information he
                        refused to give was not absolutely necessary.</p>
                    <p>
                        " ‚However,™ I said, ‚suppose you have money in this bank at your death. Wouldn™t you like to
                        have the bank transfer it to your next of kin, who is entitled to it according to law?™</p>
                    <p>
                        " ‚Yes, of course,™ he replied.</p>
                    <p>
                        " ‚Don™t you think,™ I continued, ‚that it would be a good idea to give us the name of your next
                        of kin so that, in the event of your death, we could carry out your wishes without error or
                        delay?™</p>

                        ﬁThe young man™s attitude softened and changed when he realized that we weren™t asking for this
                        information for our sake but for his sake. Before leaving the bank, this young man not only gave
                        me complete information about himself but he opened, at my suggestion, a trust account, naming
                        his mother as the beneficiary for his account, and he had gladly answered all the questions
                        concerning his mother 142</p>

                        tell: ﬁThere was a man in my territory that our company was most eager to sell to. My
                        predecessor had called on him for ten years without selling anything When I took over the
                        territory, I called steadily for three years without getting an order. Finally, after thirteen
                        years of calls and sales talk, we sold him a few motors. If these proved to be all right, an
                        order for several hundred more would follow. Such was my expectation,</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁRight? I knew they would be all right. So when I called three weeks later, I was in high
                        spirits.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁThe chief engineer greeted me with this shocking announcement: ‚Allison, I can™t buy the
                        remainder of the motors from you.™</p>
                    <p>
                        " ‚Why?™ I asked in amazement. ‚Why?™</p>
                    <p>

                        "I knew it wouldn™t do any good to argue. I had tried that sort of thing too long. So I thought
                        of getting the 'yes, yes' response.</p>
                    <p>
                        " ‚Well, now look, Mr. Smith,™ I said. ‚I agree with you a hundred percent; if those motors are
                        running too hot, you ought not to buy any more of them. You must have motors that won™t run any
                        hotter than standards set by the National Electrical Manufacturers Association. Isn™t that
                        so?™</p>

                        ﬁHe agreed it was. I had gotten my first ‚yes.™</p>
                    <p>
                        " ‚The Electrical Manufacturers Association regulations say that a properly designed motor may
                        have a temperature of 72 degrees Fahrenheit above room temperature. Is that correct?™</p>
                    <p>
                        " ‚Yes,™ he agreed. ‚That™s quite correct. But your motors are much hotter.™</p>

                    <p>"I didn™t argue with him. I merely asked: ‚How hot is the mill room?™</p>
                    <p>

                    <p>Eddie Snow, who sponsors our courses in Oakland, California, tells how he became a good customer
                        of a shop because the proprietor got him to say ﬁyes, yes.ﬂ Eddie had become interested in bow
                        hunting and had spent considerable money in purchasing equipment and supplies from a local bow
                        store. When his brother was visiting him he wanted to rent a bow for him from this store. The
                        sales clerk told him they didn™t rent bows, so Eddie phoned another bow store. Eddie described
                        what happened:</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁA very pleasant gentleman answered the phone. His response to my question for a rental was
                        completely different from the other place. He said he was sorry but they no longer rented bows
                        because they couldn™t afford to do so. He then asked me if I had rented before. I replied, ‚Yes,
                        several years ago.™ He reminded me that I probably paid $25 to $30 for the rental. I said ‚yes™
                        again. He then asked if I was the kind of person who liked to save money. Naturally, I answered
                        ‚yes.™ He went on to explain that they had bow sets with all the necessary equipment on sale for
                        $34.95. I could buy a complete set for only $4.95 more than I could rent one. He explained that
                        is why they had discontinued renting them. Did I think that was reasonable? 144</p>
                    <p>My ‚yes™ response led to a purchase of the set, and when I picked it up I purchased several more
                        items at this shop and have since become a regular customer.ﬂ</p>

                        Socrates, ﬁthe gadfly of Athens,ﬂ was one of the greatest philosophers the world has ever known.
                        He did something that only a handful of men in all history have been able to do: he sharply
                        changed the whole course of human thought; and now, twenty-four centuries after his death, he is
                        honored as one of the wisest persuaders who ever influenced this wrangling world.</p>

                        that. His whole technique, now called the ﬁSocratic method,ﬂ was based upon getting a ﬁyes, yesﬂ
                        response. He asked questions with which his opponent would have to agree. He kept on winning one
                        admission after another until he had an armful of yeses. He kept on asking questions until
                        finally, almost without realizing it, his opponents found themselves embracing a conclusion they
                        would have bitterly denied a few minutes previously.</p>

                        Does this policy pay in business? Let™s see. Here is the story of a sales representative who was
                        forced to try it.</p>
                    <p>
                        One of the largest automobile manufacturers in the United States was negotiating for a year™s
                        requirements of upholstery fabrics. Three important manufacturers had worked up fabrics in
                        sample bodies. These had all been inspected by the executives of the motor company, and notice
                        had been sent to each manufacturer saying that, on a certain day, a representative from each
                        supplier would be given an opportunity to make a final plea for the contract.</p>
                    <p>
                        G.B.R., a representative of one manufacturer, arrived in town with a severe attack of
                        laryngitis. ﬁWhen it came my turn to meet the executives in conference,ﬂ Mr. R---- said as he
                        related the story before one of my classes, ﬁI had lost my voice. I could hardly whisper. I was
                        ushered into a room and found myself face to face with the textile engineer, the purchasing
                        agent, the director of sales and the president of the company. I stood up and made a valiant
                        effort to speak, but I couldn™t do anything more than squeak.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁThey were all seated around a table, so I wrote on a pad of paper: ‚Gentlemen, I have lost my
                        voice. I am speechless.™</p>
                    <p>
                        " ‚I™ll do the talking for you,™ the president said. He did. He exhibited my samples and praised
                        their good points. A lively discussion arose about the merits of my goods. And the president,
                        since he was talking for me, took the position I would have had during the discussion My sole
                        participation consisted of smiles, nods and a few gestures. 146</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁAs a result of this unique conference, I was awarded the contract, which called for over half a
                        million yards of upholstery fabrics at an aggregate value of $1,600,000 - the biggest order I
                        had ever received.</p>

                        "I know I would have lost the contract if I hadn™t lost my voice, because I had the wrong idea
                        about the whole proposition. I discovered, quite by accident, how richly it sometimes pays to
                        let the other person do the talking.'</p>

                        Letting the other person do the talking helps in family situations as well as in business.
                        Barbara Wilson's relationship with her daughter, Laurie, was deteriorating rapidly. Laurie, who
                        had been a quiet, complacent child, had grown into an uncooperative, sometimes belligerent
                        teenager. Mrs. Wilson lectured her, threatened her and punished her, but all to no avail.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁOne day,ﬂ Mrs. Wilson told one of our classes, "I just gave up. Laurie had disobeyed me and had
                        left the house to visit her girl friend before she had completed her chores. When she returned I
                        was about to scream at her for the ten-thousandth time, but I just didn™t have the strength to
                        do it. I just looked at her and said sadly, ‚Why, Laurie, Why?™</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁLaurie noted my condition and in a calm voice asked, ‚Do you really want to know?™ I nodded and
                        Laurie told me, first hesitantly, and then it all flowed out. I had never listened to her. I was
                        always telling her to do this or that. When she wanted to tell me her thoughts, feelings, ideas,
                        I interrupted with more orders. I began to realize that she needed me - not as a bossy mother,
                        but as a confidante, an outlet for all her confusion about growing up. And all I had been doing
                        was talking when I should have been listening. I never heard her.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁFrom that time on I let her do all the talking she wanted. She tells me what is on her mind,
                        and our relationship has improved immeasurably. She is again a cooperative person.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        A large advertisement appeared on the financial page of a New York newspaper calling for a
                        person with unusual ability and experience. Charles T. Cubellis answered the advertisement,
                        sending his reply to a box number. A few days later, he was invited by letter to call for an
                        interview. Before he called, he spent hours in Wall Street finding out everything possible about
                        the person who had founded the business. During the interview, he remarked: "I should be mighty
                        proud to be 147</p>
                    <p>associated with an organization with a record like yours. I understand you started twenty-eight
                        years ago with nothing but desk room and one stenographer. Is that true?ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        Almost every successful person likes to reminisce about his early struggles. This man was no
                        exception. He talked for a long time about how he had started with $450 in cash and an original
                        idea. He told how he had fought against discouragement and battled against ridicule, working
                        Sundays and holidays, twelve to sixteen hours a day; how he had finally won against all odds
                        until now the most important executives on Wall Street were coming to him for information and
                        guidance. He was proud of such a record. He had a right to be, and he had a splendid time
                        telling about it. Finally, he questioned Mr. Cubellis briefly about his experience, then called
                        in one of his vice presidents and said: ﬁI think this is the person we are looking for.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        Mr. Cubellis had taken the trouble to find out about the accomplishments of his prospective
                        employer. He showed an interest in the other person and his problems. He encouraged the other
                        person to do most of the talking - and made a favorable impression.</p>
                    <p>Roy G. Bradley of Sacramento, California, had the opposite problem. He listened as a good
                        prospect for a sales position talked himself into a job with Bradley™s firm, Roy reported:</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁBeing a small brokerage firm, we had no fringe benefits, such as hospitalization, medical
                        insurance and pensions. Every representative is an independent agent. We don™t even provide
                        leads for prospects, as we cannot advertise for them as our larger competitors do.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁRichard Pryor had the type of experience we wanted for this position, and he was interviewed
                        first by my assistant, who told him about all the negatives related to this job. He seemed
                        slightly discouraged when he came into my office. I mentioned the one benefit of being
                        associated with my firm, that of being an independent contractor and therefore virtually being
                        self-employed.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁAs he talked about these advantages to me, he talked himself out of each negative thought he
                        had when he came in for the interview. Several times it seemed as though he was half talking to
                        himself as he was thinking through each thought. At times I was tempted to add to his thoughts;
                        however, as the interview came to a 148</p>
                    <p>close I felt he had convinced himself, very much on his own, that he would like to work for my
                        firm.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁBecause I had been a good listener and let Dick do most of the talking, he was able to weigh
                        both sides fairly in his mind, and he came to the positive conclusion, which was a challenge he
                        created for himself. We hired him and he has been an outstanding representative for our
                        firm,ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        Even our friends would much rather talk to us about their achievements than listen to us boast
                        about ours. La Rochefoucauld, the French philosopher, said: ﬁIf you want enemies, excel your
                        friends; but if you want friends, let your friends excel you.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        Why is that true? Because when our friends excel us, they feel important; but when we excel
                        them, theyŠor at least some of themŠwill feel inferior and envious.</p>

                        By far the best-liked placement counselor in the Mid-town Personnel Agency in New York City was
                        Henrietta G ---- It hadn™t always been that way. During the first few months of her association
                        with the agency, Henrietta didn™t have a single friend among her colleagues. Why? Because every
                        day she would brag about the placements she had made, the new accounts she had opened, and
                        anything else she had accomplished.</p>
                    <p>
                        "I was good at my work and proud of it,ﬂ Henrietta told one of our classes. " But instead of my
                        colleagues sharing my triumphs, they seemed to resent them. I wanted to be liked by these
                        people. I really wanted them to be my friends. After listening to some of the suggestions made
                        in this course, I started to talk about myself less and listen more to my associates. They also
                        had things to boast about and were more excited about telling me about their accomplishments
                        than about listening to my boasting. Now, when we have some time to chat, I ask them to share
                        their joys with me, and I only mention my achievements when they ask.ﬂ</p>

                        7 - HOW TO GET COOPERATION</p>
                    <p>
                        Don™t you have much more faith in ideas that you discover for yourself than in ideas that are
                        handed to you on a silver platter? If so, isn™t it bad judgment to try to ram your opinions down
                        the throats of other people? Isn™t it wiser to make suggestions - and let the other person think
                        out the conclusion?</p>
                    <p>
                        Adolph Seltz of Philadelphia, sales manager in an automobile showroom and a student in one of my
                        courses, suddenly found himself confronted with the necessity of injecting enthusiasm into a
                        discouraged and disorganized group of automobile salespeople. Calling a sales meeting, he urged
                        his people to tell him exactly what they expected from him. As they talked, he wrote their ideas
                        on the blackboard. He then said: ﬁI™ll give you all these qualities you expect from me. Now I
                        want you to tell me what I have a right to expect from you.ﬂ The replies came quick and fast:
                        loyalty, honesty, initiative, optimism, teamwork, eight hours a day of enthusiastic work, The
                        meeting ended with a new courage, a new inspiration - one salesperson volunteered to work
                        fourteen hours a day - and Mr. Seltz reported to me that the increase of sales was
                        phenomenal.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁThe people had made a sort of moral bargain with me, " said Mr. Seltz, ﬁand as long as I lived
                        up to my part in it, they were determined to live up to theirs. Consulting them about their
                        wishes and desires was just the shot in the arm they needed.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>No one likes to feel that he or she is being sold something or told to do a thing. We much prefer
                        to feel that we are buying of our own accord or acting on our own ideas. We like to be consulted
                        about our wishes, our wants, our thoughts.</p>
                    <p>
                        Take the case of Eugene Wesson. He lost countless thousands of dollars in commissions before he
                        learned this truth. Mr. Wesson sold sketches for a studio that created designs for stylists and
                        textile manufacturers. Mr. Wesson had called on one of the leading stylists in New York once a
                        week, every week for three years. ﬁHe never refused to see me,ﬂ said Mr. Wesson, ﬁbut he never
                        bought. He always looked over my sketches very carefully and then said: ‚No, Wesson, I guess we
                        don™t get together today.' "</p>
                    <p>After 150 failures, Wesson realized he must be in a mental rut, so he resolved to 150</p>
                    <p>devote one evening a week to the study of influencing human behavior, to help him develop new
                        ideas and generate new enthusiasm.</p>
                    <p>
                        He decided on this new approach. With half a dozen unfinished artists™ sketches under his arm,
                        he rushed over to the buyer™s office. "I want you to do me a little favor, if you will,ﬂ he
                        said. ﬁ‚Here are some uncompleted sketches. Won™t you please tell me how we could finish them up
                        in such a way that you could use them?ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        The buyer looked at the sketches for a while without uttering a word. Finally he said: ﬁLeave
                        these with me for a few days, Wesson, and then come back and see me.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        Wesson returned three davs later, got his suggestions, took the sketches back to the studio and
                        had them finished according to the buyer™s ideas. The result? All accepted.</p>
                    <p>
                        After that, this buyer ordered scores of other sketches from Wesson, all drawn according to the
                        buyer™s ideas. ﬁI realized why I had failed for years to sell him,ﬂ said Mr. Wesson. " I had
                        urged him to buy what I thought he ought to have. Then I changed my approach completely. I urged
                        him to give me his ideas. This made him feel that he was creating the designs. And he was. I
                        didn™t have to sell him. He bought.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        Letting the other person feel that the idea is his or hers not only works in business and
                        politics, it works in family life as well. Paul M. Davis of Tulsa, Oklahoma, told his class how
                        he applied this principle:</p>

                        ﬁMy family and I enjoyed one of the most interesting sightseeing vacation trips we have ever
                        taken. I had long dreamed of visiting such historic sites as the Civil War battlefield in
                        Gettysburg, Independence Hall in Philadelphia, and our nation™s capital. Valley Forge,
                        James-town and the restored colonial village of Williamsburg were high on the list of things I
                        wanted to see.</p>

                        ﬁIn March my wife, Nancy, mentioned that she had ideas for our summer vacation which included a
                        tour of the western states, visiting points of interest in New Mexico, Arizona, California and
                        Nevada. She had wanted to make this trip for several years. But we couldn™t obviously make both
                        trips.</p>

                    <p>ﬁOur daughter, Anne, had just completed a course in U.S. history in junior high school and had
                        become very interested in the events that had shaped our country™s growth. I asked her how she
                        would like to visit the places she had learned about on our next vacation. She said she would
                        love to.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁTwo evenings later as we sat around the dinner table, Nancy announced that if we all agreed,
                        the summer™s vacation would be to the eastern states, that it would he a great trip for Anne and
                        thrilling for all of us. We all concurred.ﬂ</p>

                        This same psychology was used by an X-ray manufacturer to sell his equipment to one of the
                        largest hospitals in Brooklyn This hospital was building an addition and preparing to equip it
                        with the finest X-ray department in America. Dr. L----, who was in charge of the X-ray
                        department, was overwhelmed with sales representatives, each caroling the praises of his own
                        company™s equipment.</p>
                    <p>
                        One manufacturer, however, was more skillful. He knew far more about handling human nature than
                        the others did. He wrote a letter something like this:</p>
                    <p>
                        Our factory has recently completed a new line of X-ray equipment. The first shipment of these
                        machines has just arrived at our office. They are not perfect. We know that, and we want to
                        improve them. So we should be deeply obligated to you if you could find time to look them over
                        and give us your ideas about how they can be made more serviceable to your profession. Knowing
                        how occupied you are, I shall be glad to send my car for you at any hour you specify.</p>
                    <p>
                        "I was surprised to get that letter,ﬂ Dr. L ---- said as he related the incident before the
                        class. ﬁI was both surprised and complimented. I had never had an X-ray manufacturer seeking my
                        advice before. It made me feel important. I was busy every night that week, but I canceled a
                        dinner appointment in order to look over the equipment. The more I studied it, the more I
                        discovered for myself how much I liked it.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁNobody had tried to sell it to me. I felt that the idea of buying that equipment for the
                        hospital was my own. I sold myself on its superior qualities and ordered it installed.ﬂ</p>

                        " ‚After I got to know the President,™ House said, ‚I learned the best way to convert him to an
                        idea was to plant it in his mind casually, but so as to interest him in it - so as to get him
                        thinking about it on his own account. The first time this worked it was an accident. I had been
                        visiting him at the White House and urged a policy on him which he appeared to disapprove. But
                        several days later, at the dinner table, I was amazed to hear him trot out my suggestion as his
                        own.™ "</p>
                    <p>
                        Did House interrupt him and say, ﬁThat™s not your idea. That™s mineﬂ ? Oh, no. Not House. He was
                        too adroit for that. He didn™t care about credit. He wanted results. So he let Wilson continue
                        to feel that the idea was his. House did even more than that. He gave Wilson public credit for
                        these ideas.</p>
                    <p>
                        Let™s remember that everyone we come in contact with is just as human as Woodrow Wilson. So
                        let™s use Colonel House™s technique.</p>
                    <p>A man up in the beautiful Canadian province of New Brunswick used this technique on me and won my
                        patronage. I was planning at the time to do some fishing and canoeing in New Brunswick. So I
                        wrote the tourist bureau for information. Evidently my name and address were put on a mailing
                        list, for I was immediately overwhelmed with scores of letters and booklets and printed
                        testimonials from camps and guides. I was bewildered. I didn™t know which to choose. Then one
                        camp owner did a clever thing. He sent me the names and telephone numbers of several New York
                        people who had stayed at his camp and he invited me to telephone them and discover for myself
                        what he had to offer.</p>
                    <p>
                        I found to my surprise that I knew one of the men on his list. I telephoned him, found out what
                        his experience had been, and then wired the camp the date of my arrival.</p>
                    <p>153</p>
                    <p>The others had been trying to sell me on their service, but one let me sell myself. That
                        organization won. Twenty-five centuries ago, Lao-tse, a Chinese sage, said some things that
                        readers of this book might use today:</p>
                    <p>
                        " The reason why rivers and seas receive the homage of a hundred mountain streams is that they
                        keep below them. Thus they are able to reign over all the mountain streams. So the sage, wishing
                        to be above men, putteth himself below them; wishing to be before them, he putteth himself
                        behind them. Thus, though his place be above men, they do not feel his weight; though his place
                        be before them, they do not count it an injury.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>PRINCIPLE 7 - Let the other person feel that the idea is his or hers.</p>

                        8 - A FORMULA THAT WILL WORK WONDERS FOR YOU</p>
                    <p>
                        Remember that other people may be totally wrong. But they don™t think so. Don™t condemn them.
                        Any fool can do that. Try to understand them. Only wise, tolerant, exceptional people even try
                        to do that.</p>
                    <p>
                        There is a reason why the other man thinks and acts as he does. Ferret out that reason - and you
                        have the key to his actions, perhaps to his personality</p>
                    <p>
                        Try honestly to put yourself in his place.</p>
                    <p>
                        If you say to yourself, ﬁHow would I feel, how would I react if I were in his shoes?ﬂ you will
                        save yourself time and irritation, for ﬁby becoming interested in the cause, we are less likely
                        to dislike the effect.ﬂ And, in addition, you will sharply increase your skill in human
                        relationships.</p>

                        ﬁStop a minute,ﬂ says Kenneth M. Goode in his book How to Turn People Into Gold, ﬁstop a minute
                        to contrast your keen interest in your own affairs with your mild concern about anything else.
                        Realize then, that everybody else in the world feels exactly the same way! Then, along with
                        Lincoln and Roosevelt, you will have grasped the only solid foundation for interpersonal
                        relationships; namely, that success in dealing with people depends on a sympathetic grasp of the
                        other persons™ viewpoint.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        Sam Douglas of Hempstead, New York, used to tell his wife that she spent too much time working
                        on their lawn, pulling weeds, fertilizing, cutting the grass twice a week when the lawn didn™t
                        look any better than it had when they moved into their home four years earlier. Naturally, she
                        was distressed by his remarks, and each time he made such remarks the balance of the evening was
                        ruined.</p>
                    <p>
                        After taking our course, Mr. Douglas realized how foolish he had been all those years. It never
                        occurred to him that she enjoyed doing that work and she might really appreciate a compliment on
                        her diligence.</p>
                    <p>
                        One evening after dinner, his wife said she wanted to pull some weeds and invited him to keep
                        her company. He first declined, but then thought better of it and went out after her and began
                        to help her pull weeds. She was visibly pleased, and together they spent an hour in hard work
                        and pleasant conversation. 155</p>
                    <p>
                        After that he often helped her with the gardening and complimented her on how fine the lawn
                        looked, what a fantastic job she was doing with a yard where the soil was like concrete. Result:
                        a happier life for both because he had learned to look at things from her point of view - even
                        if the subject was only weeds.</p>
                    <p>
                        In his book Getting Through to People, Dr. Gerald S. Nirenberg commented: "Cooperativeeness in
                        conversation is achieved when you show that you consider the other person™s ideas and feelings
                        as important as your own. Starting your conversation by giving the other person the purpose or
                        direction of your conversation, governing what you say by what you would want to hear if you
                        were the listener, and accepting his or her viewpoint will encourage the listener to have an
                        open mind to your ideas.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        I have always enjoyed walking and riding in a park near my home. Like the Druids of ancient
                        Gaul, I all but worship an oak tree, so I was distressed season after season to see the young
                        trees and shrubs killed off by needless fires. These fires weren™t caused by careless smokers.
                        They were almost all caused by youngsters who went out to the park to go native and cook a
                        frankfurter or an egg under the trees. Sometimes, these fires raged so fiercely that the fire
                        department had to be called out to fight the conflagration.</p>
                    <p>
                        There was a sign on the edge of the park saying that anyone who started a fire was liable to
                        fine and imprisonment, but the sign stood in an unfrequented part of the park, and few of the
                        culprits ever saw it. A mounted policeman was supposed to look after the park; but he didn™t
                        take his duties too seriously, and the fires continued to spread season after season. On one
                        occasion, I rushed up to a policeman and told him about a fire spreading rapidly through the
                        park and wanted him to notify the fire department, and he nonchalantly replied that it was none
                        of his business because it wasn™t in his precinct! I was desperate, so after that when I went
                        riding, I acted as a self-appointed committee of one to protect the public domain. In the
                        beginning, I am afraid I didn™t even attempt to see the other people™s point of view. When I saw
                        a fire blazing under the trees, I was so unhappy about it, so eager to do the right thing, that
                        I did the wrong thing. I would ride up to the boys, warn them that they could be jailed for
                        starting a fire, order with a tone of authority that it be put out; and, if they refused, I
                        would threaten to have them arrested. I was merely unloading my feelings without thinking of
                        their point of view.</p>
                    <p>The result? They obeyed - obeyed sullenly and with resentment. After I rode on 156</p>
                    <p>over the hill, they probably rebuilt the fire and longed to burn up the whole park. With the
                        passing of the years, I acquired a trifle more knowledge of human relations, a little more tact,
                        a somewhat greater tendency to see things from the other person™s standpoint. Then, instead of
                        giving orders, I would ride up to a blazing fire and begin something like this:</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁHaving a good time, boys? What are you going to cook for supper? . . . I loved to build fires
                        myself when I was a boy - and I still love to. But you know they are very dangerous here in the
                        park. I know you boys don™t mean to do any harm, but other boys aren™t so careful. They come
                        along and see that you have built a fire; so they build one and don™t put it out when they go
                        home and it spreads among the dry leaves and kills the trees. We won™t have any trees here at
                        all if we aren™t more careful, You could be put in jail for building this fire. But I don™t want
                        to be bossy and interfere with your pleasure. I like to see you enjoy yourselves; but won™t you
                        please rake all the leaves away from the fire right now - and you™ll be careful to cover it with
                        dirt, a lot of dirt, before you leave, won™t you? And the next time you want to have some fun,
                        won™t you please build your fire over the hill there in the sandpit? It can™t do any harm there.
                        . . . Thanks so much, boys. Have a good time.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        What a difference that kind of talk made! It made the boys want to cooperate. No sullenness, no
                        resentment. They hadn™t been forced to obey orders. They had saved their faces. They felt better
                        and I felt better because I had handled the situation with consideration for their point of
                        view.</p>
                    <p>
                        Seeing things through another person™s eyes may ease tensions when personal problems become
                        overwhelming. Elizabeth Novak of New South Wales, Australia, was six weeks late with her car
                        payment. ﬁOn a Friday,ﬂ she reported, "I received a nasty phone call from the man who was
                        handling my account informing me if I did not come up with $122 by Monday morning I could
                        anticipate further action from the company. I had no way of raising the money over the weekend,
                        so when I received his phone call first thing on Monday morning I expected the worst. Instead of
                        becoming upset I looked at the situation from his point of view. I apologized most sincerely for
                        causing him so much inconvenience and remarked that I must be his most troublesome customer as
                        this was not the first time I was behind in my payments. His tone of voice changed immediately,
                        and he reassured me that I was far from being one of his really troublesome customers. He went
                        on to tell me several examples of how rude his customers sometimes were, how they lied to him
                        and often tried to avoid talking to him at all. I said nothing. I listened and let him 157</p>
                    <p>pour out his troubles to me. Then, without any suggestion from me, he said it did not matter if I
                        couldn™t pay all the money immediately. It would be all right if I paid him $20 by the end of
                        the month and made up the balance whenever it was convenient for me to do so.ﬂ</p>

                        Tomorrow, before asking anyone to put out a fire or buy your product or contribute to your
                        favorite charity, why not pause and close your eyes and try to think the whole thing through
                        from another person™s point of view? Ask yourself: ﬁWhy should he or she want to do it?ﬂ True,
                        this will take time, but it will avoid making enemies and will get better results - and with
                        less friction and less shoe leather.</p>

                    <p>- WHAT EVERYBODY WANTS</p>
                    <p>
                        Wouldn't you like to have a magic phrase that would stop arguments, eliminate ill feeling,
                        create good will, and make the other person listen attentively?</p>
                    <p>
                        Yes? All right. Here it is: "I don™t blame you one iota for feeling as you do. If I were you I
                        would undoubtedly feel just as you do.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        An answer like that will soften the most cantankerous old cuss alive. And you can say that and
                        be 100 percent sincere, because if you were the other person you, of course, would feel just as
                        he does. Take Al Capone, for example. Suppose you had inherited the same body and temperament
                        and mind that Al Capone had. Suppose you had had his environment and experiences. You would then
                        be precisely what he wasŠand where he was. For it is those thingsŠand only those thingsŠthat
                        made him what he was. The only reason, for example, that you are not a rattlesnake is that your
                        mother and father weren™t rattlesnakes.</p>
                    <p>
                        You deserve very little credit for being what you are - and remember, the people who come to you
                        irritated, bigoted, unreasoning, deserve very little discredit for being what they are. Feel
                        sorry for the poor devils. Pity them. Sympathize with them. Say to yourself: ﬁThere, but for the
                        grace of God, go I.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        Three-fourths of the people you will ever meet are hungering and thirsting for sympathy. Give it
                        to them, and they will love you.</p>

                        I once gave a broadcast about the author of Little Women, Louisa May Alcott. Naturally, I knew
                        she had lived and written her immortal books in Concord, Massachusetts. But, without thinking
                        what I was saying, I spoke of visiting her old home in Concord. New Hampshire.</p>
                    <p>
                        If I had said New Hampshire only once, it might have been forgiven. But, alas and alack! I said
                        it twice, I was deluged with letters and telegrams, stinging messages that swirled around my
                        defenseless head like a swarm of hornets. Many were indignant. A few insulting.</p>
                    <p>One Colonial Dame, who had been reared in Concord, Massachusetts, and who was then living in
                        Philadelphia, vented her scorching wrath upon me. She couldn™t have been much more bitter if I
                        had accused Miss Alcott of being a cannibal from New 159</p>
                    <p>Guinea. As I read the letter, I said to myself, ﬁThank God, I am not married to that woman.ﬂ I
                        felt like writing and telling her that although I had made a mistake in geography, she had made
                        a far greater mistake in common courtesy. That was to be just my opening sentence. Then I was
                        going to roll up my sleeves and tell her what I really thought. But I didn™t. I controlled
                        myself. I realized that any hotheaded fool could do that - and that most fools would do just
                        that.</p>
                    <p>I wanted to be above fools. So I resolved to try to turn her hostility into friendliness. It
                        would be a challenge, a sort of game I could play. I said to myself, "After all, if I were she,
                        I would probably feel just as she does.ﬂ So, I determined to sympathize with her viewpoint.</p>
                    <p>
                        The next time I was in Philadelphia, I called her on the telephone. The conversation went
                        something like this:</p>
                    <p>
                        ME: Mrs. So-and-So, you wrote me a letter a few weeks ago, and I want to thank you for it.</p>
                    <p>
                        SHE: (in incisive, cultured, well-bred tones): To whom have I the honor of speaking?</p>
                    <p>
                        ME: I am a stranger to you. My name is Dale Carnegie. You listened to a broadcast I gave about
                        Louisa May Alcott a few Sundays ago, and I made the unforgivable blunder of saying that she had
                        lived in Concord, New Hampshire. It was a stupid blunder, and I want to apologize for it. It was
                        so nice of you to take the time to write me.</p>
                    <p>
                        SHE : I am sorry, Mr. Carnegie, that I wrote as I did. I lost my temper. I must apologize.</p>
                    <p>
                        ME: No! No! You are not the one to apologize; I am. Any school child would have known better
                        than to have said what I said. I apologized over the air the following Sunday, and I want to
                        apologize to you personally now.</p>
                    <p>
                        SHE : I was born in Concord, Massachusetts. My family centuries, and I am very proud of my
                        native state. I was really quite distressed to hear you say that Miss Alcott had lived in New
                        Hampshire. But I am really ashamed of that letter.</p>
                    <p>ME: I assure you that you were not one-tenth as distressed as I am. My error didn™t 160</p>
                    <p>hurt Massachusetts, but it did hurt me. It is so seldom that people of your standing and culture
                        take the time to write people who speak on the radio, and I do hope you will write me again if
                        you detect an error in my talks.</p>
                    <p>
                        SHE: You know, I really like very much the way you have accepted my criticism. You must be a
                        very nice person. I should like to know you better.</p>
                    <p>

                        So, because I had apologized and sympathized with her point of view, she began apologizing and
                        sympathizing with my point of view, I had the satisfaction of controlling my temper, the
                        satisfaction of returning kindness for an insult. I got infinitely more real fun out of making
                        her like me than I could ever have gotten out of telling her to go and take a jump in the
                        Schuylkill River,</p>
                    <p>
                        Every man who occupies the White House is faced almost daily with thorny problems in human
                        relations. President Taft was no exception, and he learned from experience the enormous chemical
                        value of sympathy in neutralizing the acid of hard feelings. In his book Ethics in Service, Taft
                        gives rather an amusing illustration of how he softened the ire of a disappointed and ambitious
                        mother.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁA lady in Washington,ﬂ wrote Taft, ﬁwhose husband had some political influence, came and
                        labored with me for six weeks or more to appoint her son to a position. She secured the aid of
                        Senators and Congressmen in formidable number and came with them to see that they spoke with
                        emphasis. The place was one requiring technical qualification, and following the recommendation
                        of the head of the Bureau, I appointed somebody else. I then received a letter from the mother,
                        saying that I was most ungrateful, since I declined to make her a happy woman as I could have
                        done by a turn of my hand. She complained further that she had labored with her state delegation
                        and got all the votes for an administration bill in which I was especially interested and this
                        was the way I had rewarded her.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁWhen you get a letter like that, the first thing you do is to think how you can be severe with
                        a person who has committed an impropriety, or even been a little impertinent. Then you may
                        compose an answer. Then if you are wise, you will put the letter in a drawer and lock the
                        drawer. Take it out in the course of two daysŠsuch communications will always bear two days™
                        delay in answeringŠand when you take it out after that interval, you will not send it. That is
                        just the course I took. After that, I sat down and wrote her just as polite a letter as I could,
                        telling her I realized a mother™s disappointment under such circumstances, but that really the
                        161</p>
                    <p>appointment was not left to my mere personal preference, that I had to select a man with
                        technical qualifications, and had, therefore, to follow the recommendations of the head of the
                        Bureau. I expressed the hope that her son would go on to accomplish what she had hoped for him
                        in the position which he then had. That mollified her and she wrote me a note saying she was
                        sorry she had written as she had.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁBut the appointment I sent in was not confirmed at once, and after an interval I received a
                        letter which purported to come from her husband, though it was in the the same handwriting as
                        all the others. I was therein advised that, due to the nervous prostration that had followed her
                        disappointment in this case, she had to take to her bed and had developed a most serious case of
                        cancer of the stomach. Would I not restore her to health by withdrawing the first name and
                        replacing it by her son™s? I had to write another letter, this one to the husband, to say that I
                        hoped the diagnosis would prove to be inaccurate, that I sympathized with him in the sorrow he
                        must have in the serious illness of his wife, but that it was impossible to withdraw the name
                        sent in. The man whom I appointed was confirmed, and within two days after I received that
                        letter, we gave a musicale at the White House. The first two people to greet Mrs. Taft and me
                        were this husband and wife, though the wife had so recently been in articulo mortis."</p>

                        Jay Mangum represented an elevator-escalator main-tenance company in Tulsa, Oklahoma, which had
                        the maintenance contract for the escalators in one of Tulsa™s leading hotels. The hotel manager
                        did not want to shut down the escalator for more than two hours at a time because he did not
                        want to inconvenience the hotel™s guests. The repair that had to be made would take at least
                        eight hours, and his company did not always have a specially qualified mechanic available at the
                        convenience of the hotel.</p>
                    <p>
                        When Mr. Mangum was able to schedule a top-flight mechanic for this job, he telephoned the hotel
                        manager and instead of arguing with him to give him the necessary time, he said:</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁRick, I know your hotel is quite busy and you would like to keep the escalator shutdown time to
                        a minimum. I understand your concern about this, and we want to do everything possible to
                        accommodate you. However, our diagnosis of the situation shows that if we do not do a complete
                        job now, your escalator may suffer more serious damage and that would cause a much longer
                        shutdown. I know you would not want to inconvenience your guests for several days.ﬂ 162</p>
                    <p>
                        The manager had to agree that an eight-hour shut down was more desirable than several days'. By
                        sympathizing with the manager™s desire to keep his patrons happy, Mr. Mangum was able to win the
                        hotel manager to his way of thinking easily and without rancor.</p>

                        Joyce Norris, a piano teacher in St, Louis, Missouri, told of how she had handled a problem
                        piano teachers often have with teenage girls. Babette had exceptionally long fingernails. This
                        is a serious handicap to anyone who wants to develop proper piano-playing habits.</p>
                    <p>
                        Mrs. Norris reported: ﬁI knew her long fingernails would be a barrier for her in her desire to
                        play well. During our discussions prior to her starting her lessons with me, I did not mention
                        anything to her about her nails. I didn™t want to discourage her from taking lessons, and I also
                        knew she would not want to lose that which she took so much pride in and such great care to make
                        attractive.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁAfter her first lesson, when I felt the time was right, I said: ‚Babette, you have attractive
                        hands and beautiful fingernails. If you want to play the piano as well as you are capable of and
                        as well as you would like to, you would be surprised how much quicker and easier it would be for
                        you, if you would trim your nails shorter. Just think about it, Okay?™ She made a face which was
                        definitely negative. I also talked to her mother about this situation, again mentioning how
                        lovely her nails were. Another negative reaction. It was obvious that Babette™s beautifully
                        manicured nails were important to her.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁThe following week Babette returned for her second lesson. Much to my surprise, the fingernails
                        had been trimmed. I complimented her and praised her for making such a sacrifice. I also thanked
                        her mother for influencing Babette to cut her nails. Her reply was ‚Oh, I had nothing to do with
                        it. Babette decided to do it on her own, and this is the first time she has ever trimmed her
                        nails for anyone.™ "</p>
                    <p>
                        Did Mrs. Norris threaten Babette? Did she say she would refuse to teach a student with long
                        fingernails? No, she did not. She let Babette know that her finger-nails were a thing of beauty
                        and it would be a sacrifice to cut them. She implied, ﬁI sympathize with you - I know it won™t
                        be easy, but it will pay off in your better musical development.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>Sol Hurok was probably America™s number one impresario. For almost half a 163</p>
                    <p>century he handled artists - such world-famous artists as Chaliapin, Isadora Duncan, and Pavlova.
                        Mr. Hurok told me that one of the first lessons he had learned in dealing with his temperamental
                        stars was the™ necessity for sympathy, sympathy and more sympathy with their idiosyncrasies.</p>
                    <p>
                        For three years, he was impresario for Feodor Chaliapin - one of the greatest bassos who ever
                        thrilled the ritzy boxholders at the Metropolitan, Yet Chaliapin was a constant problem. He
                        carried on like a spoiled child. To put it in Mr. Hurok™s own inimitable phrase: ﬁHe was a hell
                        of a fellow in every way.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        For example, Chaliapin would call up Mr. Hurok about noun of the day he was going to sing and
                        say, ﬁSol, I feel terrible. My throat is like raw hamburger. It is impossible for me to sing
                        tonight.ﬂ Did Mr. Hurok argue with him? Oh, no. He knew that an entrepreneur couldn™t handle
                        artists that way. So he would rush over to Chaliapin™s hotel, dripping with sympathy. ﬁWhat a
                        pity, "</p>
                    <p>he would mourn. ﬁWhat a pity! My poor fellow. Of course, you cannot sing. I will cancel the
                        engagement at once. It will only cost you a couple of thousand dollars, but that is nothing in
                        comparison to your reputation."</p>
                    <p>
                        Then Chaliapin would sigh and say, ﬁPerhaps you had better come over later in the day. Come at
                        five and see how I feel then.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        At five o™clock, Mr. Hurok would again rush to his hotel, dripping with sympathy. Again he would
                        insist on canceling the engagement and again Chaliapin would sigh and say, ﬁWell, maybe you had
                        better come to see me later. I may be better then.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        At seven-thirty the great basso would consent to sing, only with the understanding that Mr.
                        Hurok would walk out on the stage of the Metropolitan and announce that Chaliapin had a very bad
                        cold and was not in good voice. Mr. Hurok would lie and say he would do it, for he knew that was
                        the only way to get the basso out on the stage.</p>
                    <p>
                        Dr. Arthur I. Gates said in his splendid book Educational Psychology: ﬁSympathy the human
                        species universally craves. The child eagerly displays his injury; or even inflicts a cut or
                        bruise in order to reap abundant sympathy. For the same purpose adults . . . show their bruises,
                        relate their accidents, illness, especially details of surgical operations. ‚Self-pity™ for
                        misfortunes real or imaginary is in some measure, practically a universal practice."</p>
                    <p>164</p>
                    <p>So, if you want to win people to your way of thinking, put in practice . . .</p>

                    <p>
                        I was reared on the edge of the Jesse James country out in Missouri, and I visited the James
                        farm at Kearney, Missouri, where the son of Jesse James was then living.</p>
                    <p>His wife told me stories of how Jesse robbed trains and held up banks and then gave money to the
                        neighboring farmers to pay off their mortgages.</p>
                    <p>
                        Jesse James probably regarded himself as an idealist at heart, just as Dutch Schultz, "Two Gunﬂ
                        Crowley, Al Capone and many other organized crime ﬁgodfathersﬂ did generations later. The fact
                        is that all people you meet have a high regard for themselves and like to be fine and unselfish
                        in their own estimation.</p>
                    <p>
                        J. Pierpont Morgan observed, in one of his analytical interludes, that a person usually has two
                        reasons for doing a thing: one that sounds good and a real one.</p>
                    <p>
                        The person himself will think of the real reason. You don™t need to emphasize that. But all of
                        us, being idealists at heart, like to think of motives that sound good. So, in order to change
                        people, appeal to the nobler motives.</p>
                    <p>
                        Is that too idealistic to work in business? Let™s see. Let™s take the case of Hamilton J.
                        Farrell of the Farrell-Mitchell Company of Glenolden, Pennsylvania. Mr. Farrell had a
                        disgruntled tenant who threatened to move. The tenant™s lease still had four months to run;
                        nevertheless, he served notice that he was vacating immediately, regardless of lease.</p>
                    <p>
                        "These people had lived in my house all winter - the most expensive part of the year,ﬂ Mr.
                        Farrell said as he told the story to the class, ﬁand I knew it would be difficult to rent the
                        apartment again before fall. I could see all that rent income going over the hill and believe
                        me, I saw red.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁNow, ordinarily, I would have waded into that tenant and advised him to read his lease again. I
                        would have pointed out that if he moved, the full balance of his rent would fall due at once -
                        and that I could, and would, move to collect.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁHowever, instead of flying off the handle and making a scene, I decided to try other tactics.
                        So I started like this: ‚Mr. Doe,™ I said, ‚I have listened to your story, and I still don™t
                        believe you intend to move. Years in the renting business have 166</p>
                    <p>taught me something about human nature, and I sized you up in the first place as being a man of
                        your word. In fact, I™m so sure of it that I™m willing to take a gamble.</p>
                    <p>
                        " ‚Now, here™s my proposition. Lav your decision on the table for a few days and think it over.
                        If you come back to me between now and the first of the month, when your rent is due, and tell
                        me you still intend to move, I give you my word I will accept your decision as final. I will
                        privilege you to move and admit to myself I™ve been wrong in my judgment. But I still believe
                        you™re a man of your word and will live up to your contract. For after all, we are either men or
                        monkeys - and the choice usually lies with ourselves!™</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁWell, when the new month came around, this gentleman came to see me and paid his rent in
                        person. He and his wife had talked it over, he said - and decided to stay. They had concluded
                        that the only honorable thing to do was to live up to their lease.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        When the late Lord Northcliffe found a newspaper using a picture of him which he didn™t want
                        published, he wrote the editor a letter. But did he say, ﬁPlease do not publish that picture of
                        me any more; I don™t like itﬂ? No, he appealed to a nobler motive. He appealed to the respect
                        and love that all of us have for motherhood. He wrote, ﬁPlease do not publish that picture of me
                        any more. My mother doesn™t like it.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        When John D. Rockefeller, Jr., wished to stop newspaper photographers from snapping pictures of
                        his children, he too appealed to the nobler motives. He didn™t, say: ﬁI don™t want their
                        pictures published.ﬂ No, he appealed to the desire, deep in all of us, to refrain from harming
                        children. He said: ﬁYou know how it is, boys. You™ve got children yourselves, some of you. And
                        you know it™s not good for youngsters to get too much publicity.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        When Cyrus H. K. Curtis, the poor boy from Maine, was starting on his meteoric career, which was
                        destined to make him millions as owner of The Saturday Evening Post and the Ladies™ Home
                        Journal, he couldn™t afford to pay his contributors the prices that other magazines paid. He
                        couldn™t afford to hire first-class authors to write for money alone. So he appealed to their
                        nobler motives. For example, he persuaded even Louisa May Alcott, the immortal author of Little
                        Women, to write for him when she was at the flood tide of her fame; and he did it by offering to
                        send a check for a hundred dollars, not to her, but to her favorite charity. 167</p>
                    <p>
                        Right here the skeptic may say: ﬁOh, that stuff is all right for Northcliffe and Rockefeller or
                        a sentimental novelist. But, I™d like to see you make it work with the tough babies I have to
                        collect bills from!ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        You may be right. Nothing will work in all cases - and nothing will work with all people. If you
                        are satisfied with the results you are now getting, why change? If you are not satisfied, why
                        not experiment?</p>
                    <p>
                        At any rate, I think you will enjoy reading this true story told by James L. Thomas, a former
                        student of mine:</p>
                    <p>
                        Six customers of a certain automobile company refused to pay their bills for servicing. None of
                        the customers protested the entire bill, but each claimed that some one charge was wrong. In
                        each case, the customer had signed for the work done, so the company knew it was right - and
                        said so. That was the first mistake.</p>
                    <p>
                        Here are the steps the men in the credit department took to collect these overdue bills. Do you
                        suppose they succeeded?</p>
                    <p>
                        1. They called on each customer and told him bluntly that they had come to collect a bill that
                        was long past due.</p>
                    <p>
                        2. They made it very plain that the company was absolutely and unconditionally right; therefore
                        he, the customer, was absolutely and unconditionally wrong.</p>
                    <p>
                        3. They intimated that they, the company, knew more about automobiles than he could ever hope to
                        know. So what was the argument about?</p>
                    <p>
                        4. Result: They argued.</p>
                    <p>
                        Did any of these methods reconcile the customer and settle the account? You can answer that one
                        yourself.</p>
                    <p>
                        At this stage of affairs, the credit manager was about to open fire with a battery of legal
                        talent, when fortunately the matter came to the attention of the general manager. The manager
                        investigated these defaulting clients and discovered that they all had the reputation of paying
                        their bills promptly, Something was wrong here - something was drastically wrong about the
                        method of collection. So he called in 168</p>
                    <p>James L. Thomas and told him to collect these ﬁuncollectibleﬂ accounts.</p>
                    <p>
                        Here, in his words, are the steps Mr. Thrrmas took:</p>
                    <p>
                        1. My visit to each customer was likewise to collect a bill long past due - a bill that we knew
                        was absolutely right. But I didn™t say a word about that. I explained I had called to find out
                        what it was the company had done, or failed to do.</p>
                    <p>
                        2. I made it clear that, until I had heard the customer™s story, I had no opinion to offer. I
                        told him the company made no claims to being infallible.</p>
                    <p>
                        3. I told him I was interested only in his car, and that he knew more about his car than anyone
                        else in the world; that he was the authority on the subject.</p>
                    <p>
                        4. I let him talk, and I listened to him with all the interest and sympathy that he wanted - and
                        had expected.</p>
                    <p>5. Finally, when the customer was in a reasonable mood, I put the whole thing up to his sense of
                        fair play. I appealed to the nobler motives. ﬁFirst,ﬂ I said, "I want you to know I also feel
                        this matter has been badly mishandled. You™ve been inconvenienced and annoyed and irritated by
                        one of our representatives. That should never have happened. I™m sorry and, as a representative
                        of the company, I apologize. As I sat here and listened to your side of the story, I could not
                        help being impressed by your fairness and patience. And now, because you are fair - minded and
                        patient, I am going to ask you to do something for me. It™s something that you can do better
                        than anyone else, something you know more about than anyone else. Here is your bill; I know it
                        is safe for me to ask you to adjust it, just as you would do if you were the president of my
                        company. I am going to leave it all up to you. Whatever you say goes.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        Did he adjust the bill? He certainly did, and got quite a kick out of it, The bills ranged from
                        $150 to $400 - but did the customer give himself the best of it? Yes, one of them did! One of
                        them refused to pay a penny of the disputed charge; but the other five all gave the company the
                        best of it! And here™s the cream of the whole thing: we delivered new cars to all six of these
                        customers within the next two years!</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁExperience has taught me,ﬂ says Mr. Thomas, "that when no information can be secured about the
                        customer, the only sound basis on which to proceed is to assume 169</p>
                    <p>that he or she is sincere, honest, truthful and willing and anxious to pay the charges, once
                        convinced they are correct. To put it differently and perhaps mare clearly, people are honest
                        and want to discharge their obligations. The exceptions to that rule are comparatively few, and
                        I am convinced that the individuals who are inclined to chisel will in most cases react
                        favorably if you make them feel that you consider them honest, upright and fair."</p>

                        11 - THE MOVIES DO IT. TV DOES IT....WHY DON™T YOU DO IT?</p>
                    <p>
                        Many years ago, the Philadelphia Evening Bulletin was being maligned by a dangerous whispering
                        campaign. A malicious rumor was being circulated. Advertisers were being told that the newspaper
                        was no longer attractive to readers because it carried too much advertising and too little news.
                        Immediate action was necessary. The gossip had to be squelched.</p>
                    <p>
                        But how?</p>
                    <p>
                        This is the way it was done.</p>
                    <p>
                        The Bulletin clipped from its regular edition all reading matter of all kinds on one average
                        day, classified it, and published it as a book. The book was called One Day. It contained 307
                        pages - as many as a hard-covered book; yet the Bulletin had printed all this news and feature
                        material on one day and sold it, not for several dollars, but for a few cents.</p>
                    <p>
                        The printing of that book dramatized the fact that the Bulletin carried an enormous amount of
                        interesting reading matter. It conveyed the facts more vividly, more interestingly, more
                        impressively, than pages of figures and mere talk could have done.</p>
                    <p>
                        This is the day of dramatization. Merely stating a truth isn™t enough. The truth has to be made
                        vivid, interesting, dramatic. You have to use showmanship. The movies do it. Television does it.
                        And you will have to do it if you want attention.</p>
                    <p>
                        Experts in window display know the power of dramazation. For example, the manufacturers of a new
                        rat poison gave dealers a window display that included two live rats. The week the rats were
                        shown, sales zoomed to five times their normal rate.</p>
                    <p>
                        Television commercials abound with examples of the use of dramatic techniques in selling
                        products. Sit down one evening in front of your television set and analyze what the advertisers
                        do in each of their presentations. You will note how an antacid medicine changes the color of
                        the acid in a test tube while its competitor doesn™t, how one brand of soap or detergent gets a
                        greasy shirt clean when the other brand leaves it gray. You™ll see a car maneuver around a
                        series of turns and curves - far 171</p>
                    <p>better than just being told about it. Happy faces will show contentment with a variety of
                        products. All of these dramatize for the viewer the advantages offered by whatever is being sold
                        - and they do get people to buy them.</p>
                    <p>
                        You can dramatize your ideas in business or in any other aspect of your life. It™s easy. Jim
                        Yeamans, who sells for the NCR company (National Cash Register) in Richmond, Virginia, told how
                        he made a sale by dramatic demonstration.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁLast week I called on a neighborhood grocer and saw that the cash registers he was using at his
                        checkout counters were very old-fashioned. I approached the owner and told him: ‚You are
                        literally throwing away pennies every time a customer goes through your line.™ With that I threw
                        a handful of pennies on the floor. He quickly became more attentive. The mere words should have
                        been of interest to him, but the sound of Pennies hitting the floor really stopped him. I was
                        able to get an order from him to replace all of his old machines.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        It works in home life as well. When the old-time lover Proposed to his sweetheart, did he just
                        use words of love? No! He went down on his knees. That really showed he meant what he said. We
                        don™t propose on our knees any more, but many suitors still set up a romantic atmosphere before
                        they pop the question.</p>
                    <p>
                        Dramatizing what you want works with children as well. Joe B. Fant, Jr., of Birmingham, Alabama,
                        was having difficulty getting his five-year-old boy and three-year- old daughter to pick up
                        their toys, so he invented a ﬁtrain.ﬂ Joey was the engineer (Captain Casey Jones) on his
                        tricycle. Janet™s wagon was attached, and in the evening she loaded all the ﬁcoalﬂ on the
                        caboose (her wagon) and then jumped in while her brother drove her around the room. In this way
                        the room was cleaned up - without lectures, arguments or threats.</p>
                    <p>
                        Mary Catherine Wolf of Mishawaka, Indiana, was having some problems at work and decided that she
                        had to discuss them with the boss. On Monday morning she requested an appointment with him but
                        was told he was very busy and she should arrange with his secretary for an appointment later in
                        the week. The secretary indicated that his schedule was very tight, but she would try to fit her

                    <p>
                        Ms. Wolf described what happened:</p>
                    <p>"I did not get a reply from her all week long. Whenever I questioned her, she would give me a
                        reason why the boss could not see me. Friday morning came and I had 172</p>
                    <p>heard nothing definite. I really wanted to see him and discuss my problems before the weekend, so
                        I asked myself how I could get him to see me.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁWhat I finally did was this. I wrote him a formal letter. I indicated in the letter that I
                        fully understood how extremely busy he was all week, but it was important that I speak with him.
                        I enclosed a form letter and a self-addressed envelope and asked him to please fill it out or
                        ask his secretary to do it and return it to me. The form letter read as follows:</p>
                    <p>
                        Ms. Wolf - I will be able to see you on __________ a t__________A.M/P.M. I will give you
                        _____minutes of my time.</p>
                    <p>
                        "I put this letter in his in-basket at 11 A.M. At 2 P.M. I checked my mailbox. There was my
                        self-addressed envelope. He had answered my form letter himself and indicated he could see me
                        that afternoon and could give me ten minutes of his time. I met with him, and we talked for over
                        an hour and resolved my problems.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁIf I had not dramatized to him the fact that I really wanted to see him, I would probably be
                        still waiting for an appointment.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        James B. Boynton had to present a lengthy market report. His firm had just finished an
                        exhaustive study for a leading brand of cold cream. Data were needed immediately about the
                        competition in this market; the prospective customer was one of the biggestŠand most
                        formidableŠmen in the advertising business.</p>
                    <p>
                        And his first approach failed almost before he began.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁThe first time I went in,ﬂ Mr. Boynton explains, "I found myself sidetracked into a futile
                        discussion of the methods used in the investigation. He argued and I argued. He told me I was
                        wrong, and I tried to prove that I was right.</p>
                    <p>
                        "I finally won my point, to my own satisfaction - but my time was up, the interview was over,
                        and I still hadn™t produced results.</p>
                    <p>
                        "The second time, I didn™t bother with tabulations of figures and data, I went to see this man,
                        I dramatized my facts I.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁAs I entered his office, he was busy on the phone. While he finished his conversation, I opened
                        a suitcase and dumped thirty-two jars of cold cream on top 173</p>
                    <p>of his deskŠall products he knewŠall competitors of his cream.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁOn each jar, I had a tag itemizing the results of the trade investigation, And each tag told
                        its story briefly, dramatically.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁWhat happened?</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁThere was no longer an argument. Here was something new, something different. He picked up
                        first one and then another of the jars of cold cream and read the information on the tag. A
                        friendly conversation developed. He asked additional questions. He was intensely interested. He
                        had originally given me only ten minutes to present my facts, but ten minutes passed, twenty
                        minutes, forty minutes, and at the end of an hour we were still talking.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁI was presenting the same facts this time that I had presented previously. But this time I was
                        using dramatization, showmanship - and what a difference it made.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>PRINCIPLE 11 - Dramatize your ideas.</p>

                    <p>
                        12 - WHEN NOTHING ELSE WORKS, TRY THIS</p>
                    <p>
                        Charles Schwab had a mill manager whose people weren™t producing their quota of work.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁHow is it,ﬂ Schwab asked him, ﬁthat a manager as capable as you can™t make this mill turn out
                        what it should?ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        "I don™t know,ﬂ the manager replied. ﬁI™ve coaxed the men, I™ve pushed them, I™ve sworn and
                        cussed, I™ve threatened them with damnation and being fired. But nothing works. They just won™t
                        produce.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        This conversation took place at the end of the day, just before the night shift came on. Schwab
                        asked the manager for a piece of chalk, then, turning to the nearest man, asked: ﬁHow many heats
                        did your shift make today?ﬂ</p>
                    <p> "Six."</p>
                    <p>
                        Without another word, Schwab chalked a big figure six on the floor, and walked away.</p>
                    <p>
                        When the night shift came in, they saw the ﬁ6ﬂ and asked what it meant.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁThe big boss was in here today,ﬂ the day people said. ﬁHe asked us how many heats we made, and
                        we told him six. He chalked it down on the floor.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        The next morning Schwab walked through the mill again. The night shift had rubbed out ﬁ6ﬂ and
                        replaced it with a big ﬁ7.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        When the day shift reported for work the next morning, they saw a big ﬁ7ﬂ chalked on the floor.
                        So the night shift thought they were better than the day shift did they? Well, they would show
                        the night shift a thing or two. The crew pitched in with enthusiasm, and when they quit that
                        night, they left behind them an enormous, swaggering "10." Things were stepping up.</p>
                    <p>
                        Shortly this mill, which had been lagging way behind in production, was turning out more work
                        than any other mill in the plant.</p>
                    <p>175</p>
                    <p>The principle?</p>
                    <p>
                        Let Charles Schwab say it in his own words: ﬁThe way to get things done,ﬂ say Schwab, ﬁis to
                        stimulate competition. I do not mean in a sordid, money-getting way, but in the desire to
                        excel.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        The desire to excel! The challenge! Throwing down the gauntlet! An infallible way of appealing
                        to people of spirit.</p>
                    <p>
                        Without a challenge, Theodore Roosevelt would never have been President of the United States.
                        The Rough Rider, just back from Cuba, was picked for governor of New York State. The opposition
                        discovered he was no longer a legal resident of the state, and Roosevelt, frightened, wished to
                        withdraw. Then Thomas Collier Platt, then U.S. Senator from New York, threw down the challenge.
                        Turning suddenly on Theodore Roosevelt, he cried in a ringing voice: ﬁIs the hero of San Juan
                        Hill a coward?ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        Roosevelt stayed in the fight - and the rest is history. A challenge not only changed his life;
                        it had a real effect upon the future of his nation.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁAll men have fears, but the brave put down their fears and go forward, sometimes to death, but
                        always to victoryﬂ was the motto of the King™s Guard in ancient Greece. What greater challenge
                        can be offered than the opportunity to overcome those fears?</p>
                    <p>
                        When Al Smith was governor of New York, he was up against it. Sing Sing, at the time the most
                        notorious penitentiary west of Devil's Island, was without a warden. Scandals had been sweeping
                        through the pristin walls, scandals and ugly rumors. Smith needed a strong man to rule Sing Sing
                        - an iron man. But who? He sent for Lewis E. Lawes of New Hampton.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁHow about going up to take charge of Sing Sing?ﬂ he said jovially when Lawes stood before him.
                        ﬁThey need a man up there with experience.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        Lawes was flabbergasted. He knew the dangers of Sing Sing. It was a political appointment,
                        subject to the vagaries of political whims. Wardens had come and gone - one had lasted only
                        three weeks. He had a career to consider. Was it worth the risk?</p>
                    <p>176</p>
                    <p>Then Smith, who saw his hesitation, leaned back in his chair and smiled. ﬁYoung fellow,ﬂ he said,
                        ﬁI don™t blame you for being scared. It™s a tough spot. It™ll take a big person to go up there
                        and stay.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        So Smith was throwing down a challenge, was he? Lawes liked the idea of attempting a job that
                        called for someone ﬁbig.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        So he went. And he stayed. He stayed, to become the most famous warden of his time. His book
                        20,000 Years in Sing Sing sold into the hundred of thousands of copies. His broadcasts on the
                        air and his stories of prison life have inspired dozens of movies. His ﬁhumanizingﬂ of criminals
                        wrought miracles in the way of prison reform.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁI have never found,ﬂ said Harvey S. Firestone, founder of the great Firestone Tire and Rubber
                        Company, ﬁthat pay and pay alone would either bring together or hold good people. I think it was
                        the game itself.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        Frederic Herzberg, one of the great behavorial scientists, concurred. He studied in depth the
                        work attitudes of thousands of people ranging from factory workers to senior executives. What do
                        you think he found to be the most motivating factor - the one facet of the jobs that was most
                        stimulating? Money? Good working conditions? Fringe benefits? No - not any of those. The one
                        major factor that motivated people was the work itself. If the work was exciting and
                        interesting, the worker looked forward to doing it and was motivated to do a good job.</p>
                    <p>
                        That is what every successful person loves: the game. The chance for self-expression. The chance
                        to prove his or her worth, to excel, to win. That is what makes foot-races and hog-calling and
                        pie-eating contests. The desire to excel. The desire for a feeling of importance.</p>
