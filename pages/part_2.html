                    <p>
                        1 - DO THIS AND YOU™LL BE WELCOME ANYWHERE</p>
                    <p>
                        Why read this book to find out how to win friends? Why not study the technique of the greatest
                        winner of friends the world has ever known? Who is he? You may meet him tomorrow coming down the
                        street. When you get within ten feet of him, he will begin to wag his tail. If you stop and pat
                        him, he will almost jump out of his skin to show you how much he likes you. And you know that
                        behind this show of affection on his part, there are no ulterior motives: he doesn™t want to
                        sell you any real estate, and he doesn™t want to marry you.</p>
                    <p>
                        Did you ever stop to think that a dog is the only animal that doesn™t have to work for a living?
                        A hen has to lay eggs, a cow has to give milk, and a canary has to sing. But a dog makes his
                        living by giving you nothing but love.</p>
                    <p>
                        When I was five years old, my father bought a little yellow-haired pup for fifty cents. He was
                        the light and joy of my childhood. Every afternoon about four-thirty, he would sit in the front
                        yard with his beautiful eyes staring steadfastly at the path, and as soon as he heard</p>
                    <p>my voice or saw me swinging my dinner pail through the buck brush, he was off like a shot, racing
                        breathlessly up the hill to greet me with leaps of joy and barks of sheer ecstasy.</p>
                    <p>
                        Tippy was my constant companion for five years. Then one tragic nightŠI shall never forget itŠhe
                        was killed within ten feet of my head, killed by lightning. Tippy™s death was the tragedy of my
                        boyhood.</p>
                    <p>
                        You never read a book on psychology, Tippy. You didn™t need to. You knew by some divine instinct
                        that you can make more friends in two months by becoming genuinely interested in other people
                        than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you. Let me repeat that.
                        You can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in other people than you can in
                        two years by trying to get other people interested in you.</p>
                    <p>
                        Yet I know and you know people who blunder through life trying to wigwag other people into
                        becoming interested in them.</p>
                    <p>65</p>
                    <p>Of course, it doesn™t work. People are not interested in you. They are not interested in me. They
                        are interested in themselves - morning, noon and after dinner.</p>
                    <p>
                        The New York Telephone Company made a detailed study of telephone conversations to find out
                        which word is the most frequently used. You have guessed it: it is the personal pronoun ﬁI.ﬂ
                        ﬁI.ﬂ I.ﬂ It was used 3,900 times in 500 telephone conversations. "I.ﬂ ﬁI.ﬂ ﬁI.ﬂ "I.ﬂ</p>

                        When you see a group photograph that you are in, whose picture do you look for first?</p>
                    <p>
                        If we merely try to impress people and get people interested in us, we will never have many
                        true, sincere friends. Friends, real friends, are not made that way.</p>
                    <p>Napoleon tried it, and in his last meeting with Josephine he said: ﬁJosephine, I have been as
                        fortunate as any man ever was on this earth; and yet, at this hour, you are the only person in
                        the world on whom I can rely.ﬂ And historians doubt whether he could rely even on her.</p>
                    <p>
                        Alfred Adler, the famous Viennese psychologist, wrote a book entitled What Life Should Mean to
                        You. In that book he says: ﬁIt is the individual who is not interested in his fellow men who has
                        the greatest difficulties in life and provides the greatest injury to others. It is from among
                        such individuals that all human failures spring.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        You may read scores of erudite tomes on psychology without coming across a statement more
                        significant for you and for me. Adler™s statement is so rich with meaning that I am going to
                        repeat it in italics:</p>
                    <p>It is the individual who is not interested in his fellow men who has the greatest difficulties in
                        life and provides the greatest injury to others. It is from among such individuals that all
                        humun failures spring.</p>
                    <p>
                        I once took a course in short-story writing at New York University, and during that course the
                        editor of a leading magazine talked to our class. He said he could pick up any one of the dozens
                        of stories that drifted across his desk every day and after reading a few paragraphs he could
                        feel whether or not the author liked people. ﬁIf the author doesn™t like people,ﬂ he said,
                        ﬁpeople won™t like his or her stories.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>This hard-boiled editor stopped twice in the course of his talk on fiction writing and 66</p>
                    <p>apologized for preaching a sermon. ﬁI am telling you,ﬂ he said, ﬁthe same things your preacher
                        would tell you, but remember, you have to be interested in people if you want to be a successful
                        writer of stories.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        If that is true of writing fiction, you can be sure it is true of dealing with people
                        face-to-face.</p>
                    <p>
                        I spent an evening in the dressing room of Howard Thurston the last time he appeared on Broadway
                        - Thurston was the acknowledged dean of magicians. For forty years he had traveled all over the
                        world, time and again, creating illusions, mystifying audiences, and making people gasp with
                        astonishment. More than 60 million people had paid admission to his show, and he had made almost
                        $2 million in profit.</p>
                    <p>I asked Mr. Thurston to tell me the secret of his success. His schooling certainly had nothing to
                        do with it, for he ran away from home as a small boy, became a hobo, rode in boxcars, slept in
                        haystacks, begged his food from door to door, and learned to read by looking out of boxcars at
                        signs along the railway.</p>
                    <p>
                        Did he have a superior knowledge of magic? No, he told me hundreds of books had been written
                        about legerdemain and scores of people knew as much about it as he did. But he had two things
                        that the others didn™t have. First, he had the ability to put his personality across the
                        footlights. He was a master showman. He knew human nature. Everything he did, every gesture,
                        every intonation of his voice, every lifting of an eyebrow had been carefully rehearsed in
                        advance, and his actions were timed to split seconds. But, in addition to that, Thurston had a
                        genuine interest in people. He told me that many magicians would look at the audience and say to
                        themselves, ﬁWell, there is a bunch of suckers out there, a bunch of hicks; I™ll fool them all
                        right.ﬂ But Thurston™s method was totally different. He told me that every time he went on stage
                        he said to himself: ﬁI am grateful because these people come to see me, They make it possible
                        for me to make my living in a very agreeable way. I™m going to give them the very best I
                        possibly can.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        He declared he never stepped in front of the footlights without first saying to himself over and
                        over: ﬁI love my audience. I love my audience.ﬂ Ridiculous? Absurd? You are privileged to think
                        anything you like. I am merely passing it on to you without comment as a recipe used by one of
                        the most famous magicians of all time.</p>
                    <p>67</p>
                    <p>George Dyke of North Warren, Pennsylvania, was forced to retire from his service station business
                        after thirty years when a new highway was constructed over the site of his station. It wasn™t
                        long before the idle days of retirement began to bore him, so he started filling in his time
                        trying to play music on his old fiddle. Soon he was traveling the area to listen to music and
                        talk with many of the accomplished fiddlers. In his humble and friendly way he became generally
                        interested in learning the background and interests of every musician he met. Although he was
                        not a great fiddler himself, he made many friends in this pursuit. He attended competitions and
                        soon became known to the country music fans in the eastern part of the United States as ﬁUncle
                        George, the Fiddle Scraper from Kinzua County.ﬂ When we heard Uncle George, he was seventy-two
                        and enjoying every minute of his life. By having a sustained interest in other people, he
                        created a new life for himself at a time when most people consider their productive years
                        over.</p>
                    <p>
                        That, too, was one of the secrets of Theodore Roosevelt™s astonishing popularity. Even his
                        servants loved him. His valet, James E. Amos, wrote a book about him entitled Theodore
                        Roosevelt, Hero to His Valet. In that book Amos relates this illuminating incident:</p>
                    <p>
                        My wife one time asked the President about a bobwhite. She had never seen one and he described
                        it to her fully. Sometime later, the telephone at our cottage rang. [Amos and his wife lived in
                        a little cottage on the Roosevelt estate at Oyster Bay.] My wife answered it and it was Mr.
                        Roosevelt himself. He had called her, he said, to tell her that there was a bobwhite outside her
                        window and that if she would look out she might see it. Little things like that were so
                        characteristic of him. Whenever he went by our cottage, even though we were out of sight, we
                        would hear him call out: ﬁOo-oo-oo, Annie?ﬂ or ﬁOo-oo-oo, James!ﬂ It was just a friendly
                        greeting as he went by.</p>
                    <p>
                        How could employees keep from liking a man like that? How could anyone keep from liking him?
                        Roosevelt called at the White House one day when the President and Mrs. Taft were away. His
                        honest liking for humble people was shown by the fact that he greeted all the old White House
                        servants by name, even the scullery maids.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁWhen he saw Alice, the kitchen maid,ﬂ writes Archie Butt, ﬁhe asked her if she still made corn
                        bread. Alice told him that she sometimes made it for the servants, but no one ate it
                        upstairs.</p>
                    <p>68</p>
                    <p>"‚They show bad taste,™ Roosevelt boomed, ‚and I™ll tell the President so when I see him.™</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁAlice brought a piece to him on a plate, and he went over to the office eating it as he went
                        and greeting gardeners and laborers as he passed. . .</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁHe addressed each person just as he had addressed them in the past. Ike Hoover, who had been
                        head usher at the White House for forty years, said with tears in his eyes: ‚It is the only
                        happy day we had in nearly two years, and not one of us would exchange it for a hundred-dollar
                        bill.™ ﬂ</p>
                    <p>The same concern for the seemingly unimportant people helped sales representative Edward M.
                        Sykes, Jr., of Chatham, New Jersey, retain an account. ﬁMany years ago,ﬂ he reported, ﬁI called
                        on customers for Johnson and Johnson in the Massachusetts area. One account was a drug store in
                        Hingham. Whenever I went into this store I would always talk to the soda clerk and sales clerk
                        for a few minutes before talking to the owner to obtain his order. One day I went up to the
                        owner of the store, and he told me to leave as he was not interested in buying J&J products
                        anymore because he felt they were concentrating their activities on food and discount stores to
                        the detriment of the small drugstore. I left with my tail between my legs and drove around the
                        town for several hours. Finally, I decided to g</p>
                    <p>back and try at least to explain our position to the owner of the store.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁWhen I returned I walked in and as usual said hello to the soda clerk and sales clerk. When I
                        walked up to the owner, he smiled at me and welcomed me back. He then gave me double the usual
                        order, I looked at him with surprise and asked him what had happened since my visit only a few
                        hours earlier. He pointed to the young man at the soda fountain and said that after I had left,
                        the boy had come over and said that I was one of the few salespeople that called on the store
                        that even bothered to say hello to him and to the others in the store</p>
                    <p>He told the owner that if any salesperson deserved his business, it was I. The owner agreed and
                        remained a loyal customer. I never forgo</p>
                    <p>that to be genuinely interested in other people is a most important quality for a sales-person to
                        possessŠfor any person, for that matter.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        I have discovered from personal experience that one can win the attention and time and
                        cooperation of even the most sought-after people by becoming genuinely interested in them. Let
                        me illustrate.</p>
                    <p>Years ago I conducted a course in fiction writing at the Brooklyn Institute of Arts 69</p>
                    <p>and Sciences, and we wanted such distinguished and busy authors as Kathleen Norris, Fannie Hurst,
                        Ida Tarbell, Albert Payson Terhune and Rupert Hughes to come to Brooklyn and give us the benefit
                        of their experiences. So we wrote them, saying we admired their work and were deeply interested
                        in getting their advice and learning the secrets of their success.</p>
                    <p>
                        Each of these letters was signed by about a hundred and fifty students. We said we realized that
                        these authors were busyŠtoo busy to prepare a lecture. So we enclosed a list of questions for
                        them to answer about themselves and their methods of work. They liked that. Who wouldn™t like
                        it? So they left their homes and traveled to Brooklyn to give us a helping hand.</p>
                    <p>
                        By using the same method, I persuaded Leslie M. Shaw, secretary of the treasury in Theodore
                        Roosevelt™s cabinet; George W. Wickersham, attorney general in Taft™s cabinet; William Jennings
                        Bryan; Franklin D. Roosevelt and many other prominent men to come to talk to the students of my
                        courses in public speaking.</p>
                    <p>
                        All of us, be we workers in a factory, clerks in an office or even a king upon his throneŠall of
                        us like people who admire us. Take the German Kaiser, for example. At the close of World War I
                        he was probably the most savagely and universally despised man on this earth. Even his own
                        nation turned against him when he fled over into Holland to save his neck. The hatred against
                        him was so intense that millions of people would have loved to tear him limb from limb or burn
                        him at the stake. In the midst of all this forest fire of fury, one little boy wrote the Kaiser
                        a simple, sincere letter glowing with kindliness and admiration. This little boy said that no
                        matter what the others thought, he would always love Wilhelm as his Emperor. The Kaiser was
                        deeply touched by his letter and invited the little boy to come to see him. The boy came, so did
                        his motherŠand the Kaiser married her. That little boy didn™t need to read a book on how to win
                        friends and influence people. He knew how instinctively.</p>
                    <p>
                        If we want to make friends, let™s put ourselves out to do things for other peopleŠthings that
                        require time, energy, unselfishness and thoughtfulness. When the Duke of Windsor was Prince of
                        Wales, he was scheduled to tour South America, and before he started out on that tour he spent
                        months studying Spanish so that he could make public talks in the language of the country; and
                        the South Americans loved him for it.</p>
                    <p>For years I made it a point to find out the birthdays of my friends. How? Although I 70</p>
                    <p>haven™t the foggiest bit of faith in astrology, I began by asking the other party whether he
                        believed the date of one™s birth has anything to do with character and disposition. I then asked
                        him or her to tell me the month and day of birth. If he or she said November 24, for example, I
                        kept repeating to myself, ﬁNovember 24, November 24.ﬂ The minute my friend™s back was turned, I
                        wrote down the name and birthday and later would transfer it to a birthday book. At the
                        beginning of each year, I had these birthday dates scheduled in my calendar pad so that they
                        came to my attention automatically. When the natal day arrived, there was my letter or telegram.
                        What a hit it made! I was frequently the only person on earth who remembered.</p>
                    <p>
                        If we want to make friends, let™s greet people with animation and enthusiasm. When somebody
                        calls you on the telephone use the same psychology. Say ﬁHelloﬂ in tones that bespeak how
                        pleased YOU are to have the person call. Many companies train their telephone operators to greet
                        all callers in a tone of voice that radiates interest and enthusiasm. The caller feels the
                        company is concerned about them. Let™s remember that when we answer the telephone tomorrow.</p>
                    <p>Showing a genuine interest in others not only wins friends for you, but may develop in its
                        customers a loyalty to your company. In an issue of the publication of the National Bank of
                        North America of New York, the following letter from Madeline Rosedale, a depositor, was
                        published:</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁI would like you to know how much I appreciate your staff. Everyone is so courteous, polite and
                        helpful. What a pleasure it is, after waiting on a long line, to have the teller greet you
                        pleasantly.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁLast year my mother was hospitalized for five months. Frequently I went to Marie Petrucello, a
                        teller. She was concerned about my mother and inquired about her progress.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        Is there any doubt that Mrs. Rosedale will continue to use this bank?</p>
                    <p>
                        Charles R. Walters, of one of the large banks in New York City, was assigned to prepare a
                        confidential report on a certain corporation. He knew of only one person who possessed the facts
                        he needed so urgently. As Mr. Walters was ushered into the president™s office, a young woman
                        stuck her head through a door and told the president that she didn™t have any stamps for him
                        that day.</p>
                    <p>71</p>
                    <p>"I am collecting stamps for my twelve-year-old son,ﬂ the president explained to Mr. Walters.</p>
                    <p>
                        Mr. Walters stated his mission and began asking questions. The president was vague, general,
                        nebulous. He didn™t want to talk, and apparently nothing could persuade him to talk. The
                        interview was brief and barren.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁFrankly, I didn™t know what to do,ﬂ Mr. Walters said as he related the story to the class.
                        ﬁThen I remembered what his secretary had said to him - stamps, twelve-year-old son. . . And I
                        also recalled that the foreign department of our bank collected stamps - stamps taken from
                        letters pouring in from every continent washed by the seven seas.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁThe next afternoon I called on this man and sent in word that I had some stamps for his boy.
                        Was I ushered in with enthusiasm? Yes sir, He couldn™t have shaken my hand with more enthusiasm
                        if he had been running for Congress. He radiated smiles and good will. ‚My George will love this
                        one,™ he kept saying as he fondled the stamps. ‚And look at this! This is a treasure.™</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁWe spent half an hour talking stamps and looking at a picture of his boy, and he then devoted
                        more than an hour of his time to giving me every bit of information I wanted - without my even
                        suggesting that he do it. He told me all he knew, and then called in his subordinates and
                        questioned them. He telephoned some of his associates. He loaded me down with facts, figures,
                        reports and correspondence. In the parlance of newspaper reporters, I had a scoop.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        Here is another illustration:</p>
                    <p>
                        C. M. Knaphle, Jr., of Philadelphia had tried for years to sell fuel to a large chain-store
                        organization. But the chain-store company continued to purchase its fuel from an out-of-town
                        dealer and haul it right past the door of Knaphle™s office. Mr, Knaphle made a speech one night
                        before one of my classes, pouring out his hot wrath upon chain stores, branding them as a curse
                        to the nation.</p>
                    <p>
                        And still he wondered why he couldn™t sell them.</p>
                    <p>
                        I suggested that he try different tactics. To put it briefly, this is what happened. We staged a
                        debate between members of the course on whether the spread of the chain store is doing the
                        country more harm than good. 72</p>
                    <p>
                        Knaphle, at my suggestion, took the negative side; he agreed to defend the chain stores, and
                        then went straight to an executive of the chain-store organization that he despised and said: ﬁI
                        am not here to try to sell fuel. I have come to ask you to do me a favor.ﬂ He then told about
                        his debate and said, ﬁI have come to you for help because I can™t think of anyone else who would
                        be more capable of giving me the facts I want. I™m anxious to win this debate, and I™ll deeply
                        appreciate whatever help you can give me.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        Here is the rest of the story in Mr. Knaphle™s own words:</p>
                    <p>
                        I had asked this man for precisely one minute of his time. It was with that understanding that
                        he consented to see me. After I had stated my case, he motioned me to a chair and talked to me
                        for exactly one hour and forty-seven minutes. He called in another executive who had written a
                        book on chain stores. He wrote to the National Chain Store Association and secured for me a copy
                        of a debate on the subject. He feels that the chain store is rendering a real service to
                        humanity. He is proud of what he is doing for hundreds of communities. His eyes fairly glowed as
                        he talked, and I must confess that he opened my eyes to things I had never even dreamed of. He
                        changed my whole mental attitude. As I was leaving, he walked with me to the door, put his arm
                        around my shoulder, wished me well in my debate, and asked me to stop in and see him again and
                        let him know how I made out. The last words he said to me were: ﬁPlease see me again later in
                        the spring. I should like to place an order with you for fuel.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        To me that was almost a miracle. Here he was offering to buy fuel without my even suggesting it.
                        I had made more headway in two hours by becoming genuinely interested in him and his problems
                        than I could have made in ten years trying to get him interested in me and my product.</p>
                    <p>
                        You didn™t discover a new truth, Mr. Knaphle, for a long time ago, a hundred years before Christ
                        was born a famous old Roman poet, Publilius Syrus, remarked; ﬁWe are interested in others when
                        they are interested in us."</p>
                    <p>
                        A show of interest, as with every other principle of human relations, must be sincere. It must
                        pay off not only for the person showing the interest, but for the person receiving the
                        attention. It is a two-way street-both parties benefit.</p>
                    <p>Martin Ginsberg, who took our Course in Long Island New York, reported how the 73</p>
                    <p>special interest a nurse took in him profoundly affected his life:</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁIt was Thanksgiving Day and I was ten years old. I was in a welfare ward of a city hospital and
                        was scheduled to undergo major orthopedic surgery the next day. I knew that I could only look
                        forward to months of confinement, convalescence and pain. My father was dead; my mother and I
                        lived alone in a small apartment and we were on welfare. My mother was unable to visit me that
                        day.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁAs the day went on, I became overwhelmed with the feeling of loneliness, despair and fear. I
                        knew my mother was home alone worrying about me, not having anyone to be with, not having anyone
                        to eat with and not even having enough money to afford a Thanksgiving Day dinner.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁThe tears welled up in my eyes, and I stuck my head under the pillow and pulled the covers over
                        it, I cried silently, but oh so bitterly, s much that my body racked with pain.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁA young student nurse heard my sobbing and came over to me. She took the covers off my face and
                        started wiping my tears. She told me how lonely she was, having to work that day and not being
                        able to be with her family. She asked me whether I would have dinner with her. She brought two
                        trays of food: sliced turkey, mashed potatoes, cranberry sauce and ice cream for dessert. She
                        talked to me and tried to calm my fears. Even though she was scheduled to go off duty at 4 P.M.,
                        she stayed on her own time until almost 11 P.M. She played games with me, talked to me and
                        stayed with me until I finally fell asleep.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁMany Thanksgivings have come and gone since I was ten, but one never passes without me
                        remembering that particular one and my feelings of frustration, fear, loneliness and the warmth
                        and tenderness of the stranger that somehow made it all bearable.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        If you want others to like you, if you want to develop real friendships, if you want to help
                        others at the same time as you help yourself, keep this principle in mind:</p>
                    <p>
                        PRINCIPLE 1 - Become genuinely interested in other people.</p>

                    <p>2 - A SIMPLE WAY TO MAKE A GOOD FIRST IMPRESSION</p>
                    <p>
                        At a dinner party in New York, one of the guests, a woman who had inherited money, was eager to
                        make a pleasing impression on everyone. She had squandered a modest fortune on sables, diamonds
                        and pearls. But she hadn™t done anything whatever about her face. It radiated sourness and
                        selfishness. She didn™t realize what everyone knows: namely, that the expression one wears on
                        one™s face is far more important than the clothes one wears on one™s back.</p>
                    <p>
                        Charles Schwab told me his smile had been worth a million dollars. And he was probably
                        understating the truth. For Schwab™s personality, his charm, his ability to make people like
                        him, were almost wholly responsible for his extraordinary success; and one of the most
                        delightful factors in his personality was his captivating smile.</p>
                    <p>
                        Actions speak louder than words, and a smile says, ﬁI like you, You make me happy. I am glad to
                        see you.ﬂ That is why dogs make such a hit. They are so glad to see us that they almost jump out
                        of their skins. So, naturally, we are glad to see them.</p>
                    <p>
                        A baby™s smile has the same effect.</p>
                    <p>
                        Have you ever been in a doctor™s waiting room and looked around at all the glum faces waiting
                        impatiently to be seen? Dr, Stephen K. Sproul, a veterinarian in Raytown, Missouri, told of a
                        typical spring day when his waiting room was full of clients waiting to have their pets
                        inoculated. No one was talking to anyone else, and all were probably thinking of a dozen other
                        things they would rather be doing than ﬁwasting timeﬂ sitting in that office. He told one of our
                        classes: ﬁThere were six or seven clients waiting when a young woman came in with a
                        nine-month-old baby and a kitten. As luck would have it, she sat down next to a gentleman who
                        was more than a little distraught about the long wait for service. The next thing he knew, the
                        baby just looked up at him with that great big smile that is so characteristic of babies. What
                        did that gentleman do? Just what you and I would do, of course; he smiled back at the baby. Soon
                        he struck up a conversation with the woman about her baby and his grandchildren, and soon the
                        entire reception room joined in, and the boredom and tension were converted into a pleasant and
                        enjoyable experience.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        An insincere grin? No. That doesn™t fool anybody. We know it is mechanical and we resent it. I
                        am talking about a real smile, a heartwarming smile, a smile that 75</p>
                    <p>comes from within, the kind of smile that will bring a good price in the marketplace.</p>
                    <p>
                        Professor James V. McConnell, a psychologist at the University of Michigan, expressed his
                        feelings about a smile. ﬁPeople who smile,ﬂ he said, ﬁtend to manage teach and sell more
                        effectively, and to raise happier children. There™s far more information in a smile than a
                        frown. That™s why encouragement is a much more effective teaching device than punishment.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>The employment manager of a large New York department store told me she would rather hire a sales
                        clerk who hadn™t finished grade school, if he or she has a pleasant smile, than to hire a doctor
                        of philosophy with a somber face.</p>
                    <p>
                        The effect of a smile is powerful - even when it is unseen. Telephone companies throughout the
                        United States have a program called ﬁphone powerﬂ which is offered to employees who use the
                        telephone for selling their services or products. In this program they suggest that you smile
                        when talking on the phone. Your ﬁsmileﬂ comes through in your voice.</p>
                    <p>
                        Robert Cryer, manager of a computer department for a Cincinnati, Ohio, company, told how he had
                        successfully found the right applican for a hard-to-fill position:</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁI was desperately trying to recruit a Ph.D. in computer science for my department. I finally
                        located a young man with ideal qualification</p>
                    <p>who was about to be graduated from Purdue University. After several phone conversations I learned
                        that he had several offers from other companies, many of them larger and better known than mine.
                        I was delighted when he accepted my offer. After he started on the job, I asked him why he had
                        chosen us over the others. He paused for a moment and then he said: ‚I think it was because
                        managers in the other companies spoke on the phone in a cold, business-like manner, which made
                        me feel like just another business transaction, Your voice sounded as if you were glad to hear
                        from me . . . that you really wanted me to be part of your organization. ™ You can be assured, I
                        am still answering my phone with a smile.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        The chairman of the board of directors of one of the largest rubber companies ‚in the United
                        States told me that, according to his observations, people rarely succeed at anything unless
                        they have fun doing it. This industrial leader doesn™t put much faith in the old adage that hard
                        work alone is the magic key that will unlock the door to our desires, ﬁI have known people,ﬂ he
                        said, ﬁwho succeeded because they 76</p>
                    <p>had a rip-roaring good time conducting their business. Later, I saw those people change as the
                        fun became work. The business had grown dull, They lost all joy in it, and they failed.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        You must have a good time meeting people if you expect them to have a good time meeting you.</p>
                    <p>
                        I have asked thousands of business people to smile at someone every hour of the day for a week
                        and then come to class and talk about the results. How did it work? Let™s see. . . Here is a
                        letter from William B. Steinhardt, a New York stockbroker. His case isn™t isolated. In fact, it
                        is typical of hundreds of cases.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁ1 have been married for over eighteen years,ﬂ wrote Mr. Steinhardt, ﬁand in all that time I
                        seldom smiled at my wife or spoke two dozen words to her from the time I got up until I was
                        ready to leave for business. I was one of the worst grouches who ever walked down Broadway.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁWhen you asked me to make a talk about my experience with smiles, I thought I would try it for
                        a week. So the next morning, while combing my hair, I looked at my glum mug in the mirror and
                        said to myself, ‚Bill, you are going to wipe the scowl off that sour puss of yours today. You
                        are going to smile. And you are going to begin right now.™ As I sat down to breakfast, I greeted
                        my wife with a ‚Good morning, my dear,™ and smiled as I said it.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁYou warned me that she might be surprised. Well, you underestimated her reaction. She was
                        bewildered. She was shocked. I told her that in the future she could expect this as a regular
                        occurrence, and I kept it up every morning.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁThis changed attitude of mine brought more happiness into our home in the two months since I
                        started than there was during the last year.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁAs I leave for my office, I greet the elevator operator in the apartment house with a ‚Good
                        morning™ and a smile, I greet the doorman with a smile. I smile at the cashier in the subway
                        booth when I ask for change. As I stand on the floor of the Stock Exchange, I smile at people
                        who until recently never saw me smile.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁI soon found that everybody was smiling back at me, I treat those who come to me with
                        complaints or grievances in a cheerful manner, I smile as I listen to them and I find that
                        adjustments are accomplished much easier. I find that smiles are bringing 77</p>
                    <p>me dollars, many dollars every day.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁI share my office with another broker. One of his clerks is a likable young chap, and I was so
                        elated about the results I was getting that I told him recently about my new philosophy of human
                        relations. He then confessed that when I first came to share my office with his firm he thought
                        me a terrible grouch - and only recently changed his mind. He said I was really human when I
                        smiled.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁI have also eliminated criticism from my system. I give appreciation and praise now instead of
                        condemnation. I have stopped talking about what I want. I am now trying to see the other
                        person™s viewpoint. And these things have literally revolutionized my life. I am a totally
                        different man, a happier man, a richer man, richer in friendships and happiness - the only
                        things that matter much after all.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        You don™t feel like smiling? Then what? Two things. First, force yourself to smile. If you are
                        alone, force yourself to whistle or hum a tune or sing. Act as if you were already happy, and
                        that will tend to make you happy. Here is the way the psychologist and philosopher William James
                        put it:</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁAction seems to follow feeling, but really action and feeling go together; and by regulating
                        the action, which is under the more direct control of the will, we can indirectly regulate the
                        feeling, which is not.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁThus the sovereign voluntary path to cheerfulness, if our cheerfulness be lost, is to sit up
                        cheerfully and to act and speak as if cheerfulness were already there. . . .ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        Every body in the world is seeking happiness - and there is one sure way to find it. That is by
                        controlling your thoughts. Happiness doesn™t depend on outward conditions. It depends on inner
                        conditions.</p>
                    <p>
                        It isn™t what you have or who you are or where you are or what you are doing that makes you
                        happy or unhappy. It is what you think about it. For example, two people may be in the same
                        place, doing the same thing; both may have about an equal amount of money and prestige - and yet
                        one may be miserable and the other happy. Why? Because of a different mental attitude. I have
                        seen just as many happy faces among the poor peasants toiling with their primitive tools in the
                        devastating heat of the tropics as I have seen in air-conditioned offices in New York, Chicago
                        or Los Angeles.</p>
                    <p>78</p>
                    <p>ﬁThere is nothing either good or bad,ﬂ said Shakespeare, ﬁbut thinking makes it so.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        Abe Lincoln once remarked that ﬁmost folks are about as happy as they make up their minds to
                        be.ﬂ He was right. I saw a vivid illustration of that truth as I was walking up the stairs of
                        the Long Island Railroad station in New York. Directly in front of me thirty or forty crippled
                        boys on canes and crutches were struggling up the stairs. One boy had to be carried up. I was
                        astonished at their laughter and gaiety. I spoke about it to one of.the men in charge of the
                        boys. ﬁOh, yes,ﬂ he said, ﬁwhen a boy realizes that he is going to be a cripple for life, he is
                        shocked at first; but after he gets over the shock, he usually resigns himself to his fate and
                        then becomes as happy as normal boys.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        I felt like taking my hat off to those boys. They taught me a lesson I hope I shall never
                        forget.</p>
                    <p>
                        Working all by oneself in a closed-off room in an office not only is lonely, but it denies one
                        the opportunity of making friends with other employees in the company. Señora Maria Gonzalez of
                        Guadalajara, Mexico, had such a job. She envied the shared comradeship of other people in the
                        company as she heard their chatter and laughter. As she passed them in the hall during the first
                        weeks of her employment, she shyly looked the other way.</p>
                    <p>
                        After a few weeks, she said to herself, ﬁMaria, you can™t expect those women to come to you. You
                        have to go out and meet them. ﬂ The next time she walked to the water cooler, she put on her
                        brightest smile and said, ﬁHi, how are you todayﬂ to each of the people she met.</p>
                    <p>
                        The effect was immediate. Smiles and hellos were returned, the hallway seemed brighter, the job
                        friendlier.</p>
                    <p>
                        Acquaintanceships developed and some ripened into friendships. Her job and her life became more
                        pleasant and interesting.</p>
                    <p>
                        Peruse this bit of sage advice from the essayist and publisher Elbert Hubbard - but remember,
                        perusing it won™t do you any good unless you apply it:</p>
                    <p>
                        Whenever you go out-of-doors, draw the chin in, carry the crown of the head high, and fill the
                        lungs to the utmost; drink in the sunshine; greet your friends with a smile, and put soul into
                        every handclasp. Do not fear being misunderstood and do 79</p>
                    <p>not waste a minute thinking about your enemies. Try to fix firmly in your mind what you would
                        like to do; and then, without veering off direction, you will move straight to the goal. Keep
                        your mind on the great and splendid things you would like to do, and then, as the days go
                        gliding away, you will find yourself unconsciously seizing upon the opportunities that are
                        required for the fulfillment of your desire, just as the coral insect takes from the running
                        tide the element it needs. Picture in your mind the able, earnest, useful person you desire to
                        be, and the thought you hold is hourly transforming you into that particular individual. . . .
                        Thought is supreme. Preserve a right mental attitude - the attitude of courage, frankness, and
                        good cheer. To think rightly is to create. All things come through desire and every sincere
                        prayer is answered. We become like that on which our hearts are fixed. Carry your chin in and
                        the crown of your head high. We are gods in the chrysalis.</p>
                    <p>
                        The ancient Chinese were a wise lot - wise in the ways of the world; and they had a proverb that
                        you and I ought to cut out and paste inside our hats. It goes like this: ﬁA man without a
                        smiling face must not open a shop.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        Your smile is a messenger of your good will. Your smile brightens the lives of all who see it.
                        To someone who has seen a dozen people frown, scowl or turn their faces away, your smile is like
                        the sun breaking throughthe clouds. Especially when that someone is under pressure from his
                        bosses, his customers, his teachers or parents or children, a smile can help him realize that
                        all is not hopeless - that there is joy in the world.</p>
                    <p>
                        Some years ago, a department store in New York City, in recognition of the pressures its sales
                        clerks were under during the Christmas rush, presented the readers of its advertisements with
                        the following homely philosophy:</p>
                    <p>

                        THE VALUE OF A SMILE AT CHRISTMAS</p>
                    <p>
                        It costs nothing, but creates much. It enriches those who receive, without impoverishing those
                        who give.</p>
                    <p>
                        It happens in a flash and the memory of it sometimes lasts forever,</p>
                    <p>None are so rich they can get along without it, and none so poor but are richer for its
                        benefits.</p>
                    <p>80</p>
                    <p>It creates happiness in the home, fosters good will in a business, and is the countersign of
                        friends.</p>
                    <p>
                        It is rest to the weary, daylight to the discouraged, sunshine to the sad, and Nature™s best
                        antidote fee trouble.</p>
                    <p>
                        Yet it cannot be bought, begged, borrowed, or stolen, for it is something that is no earthly
                        good to anybody till it is given away.</p>
                    <p>
                        And if in the last-minute rush of Christmas buying some of our salespeople should be too tired
                        to give you a smile, may we ask you to leave one of yours?</p>
                    <p>
                        For nobody needs a smile so much as those who have none left to give!</p>
                    <p>

                    <p>3 - IF YOU DON™T DO THIS, YOU ARE HEADED FOR TROUBLE</p>
                    <p>
                        Back in 1898, a tragic thing happened in Rockland County, New York. A child had died, and on
                        this particular day the neighbors were preparing to go to the funeral.</p>
                    <p>
                        Jim Farley went out to the barn to hitch up his horse. The ground was covered with snow, the air
                        was cold and snappy; the horse hadn™t been exercised for days; and as he was led out to the
                        watering trough, he wheeled playfully, kicked both his heels high in the air, and killed Jim
                        Farley. So the little village of Stony Point had two funerals that week instead of one.</p>
                    <p>
                        Jim Farley left behind him a widow and three boys, and a few hundred dollars in insurance.</p>
                    <p>His oldest boy, Jim, was ten, and he went to work in a brickyard, wheeling sand and pouring it
                        into the molds and turning the brick on edge to be dried by the sun. This boy Jim never had a
                        chance to get much education. But with his natural geniality, he had a flair for making people
                        like him, so he went into politics, and as the years went by, he developed an uncanny ability
                        for remembering people™s names.</p>
                    <p>
                        He never saw the inside of a high school; but before he was forty-six years of age, four
                        colleges had honored him with degrees and he had become chairman of the Democratic National
                        Committee and Postmaster General of the United States.</p>
                    <p>
                        I once interviewed Jim Farley and asked him the secret of his success. He said, ﬁHard work,ﬂ and
                        I said, ﬁDon™t be funny.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        He then asked me what I thought was the reason for his success. I replied: "I understand you can
                        call ten thousand people by their first names.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁNo. You are wrong, " he said. ﬁI can call fifty thousand people by their first names.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        Make no mistake about it. That ability helped Mr. Farley put Franklin D. Roosevelt in the White
                        House when he managed Roosevelt™s campaign in 1932.</p>
                    <p>
                        During the years that Jim Farley traveled as a salesman for a gypsum concern, and during the
                        years that he held office as town clerk in Stony Point, he built up a system for remembering
                        names. 82</p>
                    <p>
                        In the beginning, it was a very simple one. Whenever he met a new acquaintance, he found out his
                        or her complete name and some facts about his or her family, business and political opinions. He
                        fixed all these facts well in mind as part of the picture, and the next time he met that person,
                        even if it was a year later, he was able to shake hands, inquire after the family, and ask about
                        the hollyhocks in the backyard. No wonder he developed a following!</p>
                    <p>
                        For months before Roosevelt™s campaign for President began, Jim Farley wrote hundreds of letters
                        a day to people all over the western and northwestern states. Then he hopped onto a train and in
                        nineteen days covered twenty states and twelve thousand miles, traveling by buggy, train,
                        automobile and boat. He would drop into town, meet his people at lunch or breakfast, tea or
                        dinner, and give them a ﬁheart-to-heart talk.ﬂ Then he™d dash off again on another leg of his
                        journey.</p>
                    <p>As soon as he arrived back East, he wrote to one person in each town he had visited, asking for a
                        list of all the guests to whom he had talked. The final list contained thousands and thousands
                        of names; yet each person on that list was paid the subtle flattery of getting a personal letter
                        from James Farley. These letters began ﬁDear Billﬂ or ﬁDear Jane,ﬂ and they were always signed
                        "Jim."</p>
                    <p>
                        Jim Farley discovered early in life that the average person is more interested in his or her own
                        name than in all the other names on earth put together. Remember that name and call it easily,
                        and you have paid a subtle and very effective compliment. But forget it or misspell it - and you
                        have placed yourself at a sharp disadvantage. For example, I once organized a public-speaking
                        course in Paris and sent form letters to all the American residents in the city. French typists
                        with apparently little knowledge of English filled in the names and naturally they made
                        blunders. One man, the manager of a large American bank in Paris, wrote me a scathing rebuke
                        because his name had been misspelled.</p>
                    <p>Sometimes it is difficult to remember a name, particularly if it is hard to pronounce. Rather
                        than even try to learn it, many people ignore it or call the person by an easy nickname. Sid
                        Levy called on a customer for some time whose name was Nicodemus Papadoulos. Most people just
                        called him ﬁNick.ﬂ Levy told us: ﬁI made a special effort to say his name over several times to
                        myself before I made my call. When I greeted him by his full name: 'Good afternoon, Mr.
                        Nicodemus Papadoulos,™ he was shocked. For what seemed like several minutes there was no reply
                        from him at all. Finally, he said with tears rolling down his cheeks, ‚Mr. Levy, 83</p>
                    <p>in all the fifteen years I have been in this country, nobody has ever made the effort to call me
                        by my right name.™ "</p>
                    <p>
                        What was the reason for Andrew Carnegie™s success?</p>
                    <p>
                        He was called the Steel King; yet he himself knew little about the manufacture of steel. He had
                        hundreds of people working for him who knew far more about steel than he did.</p>
                    <p>
                        But he knew how to handle people, and that is what made him rich. Early in life, he showed a
                        flair for organization, a genius for leadership. By the time he was ten, he too had discovered
                        the astounding importance people place on their own name. And he used that discovery to win
                        cooperation. To illustrate: When he was a boy back in Scotland, he got hold of a rabbit, a
                        mother rabbit. Presto! He soon had a whole nest of little rabbits - and nothing to feed them.
                        But he had a brilliant idea. He told the boys and girls in the neighborhood that if they would
                        go out and pull enough clover and dandelions to feed the rabbits, he would name the bunnies in
                        their honor.</p>
                    <p>
                        The plan worked like magic, and Carnegie never forgot it.</p>
                    <p>
                        Years later, he made millions by using the same psychology in business. For example, he wanted
                        to sell steel rails to the Pennsylvania Railroad. J. Edgar Thomson was the president of the
                        Pennsylvania Railroad then. So Andrew Carnegie built a huge steel mill in Pittsburgh and called
                        it the ﬁEdgar Thomson Steel Works.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        Here is a riddle. See if you can guess it. When the Pennsylvania Railroad needed steel rails,
                        where do you suppose J. Edgar Thomson bought them?. . , From Sears, Roebuck? No. No. You™re
                        wrong. Guess again. When Carnegie and George Pullman were battling each other for supremacy in
                        the railroad sleeping-car business, the Steel King again remembered the lesson of the
                        rabbits.</p>
                    <p>
                        The Central Transportation Company, which Andrew Carnegie controlled, was fighting with the
                        company that Pullman owned. Both were struggling to get the sleeping-car business of the Union
                        Pacific Railroad, bucking each other, slashing prices, and destroving all chance of profit. Both
                        Carnegie and Pullman had gone to New York to see the board of directors of the Union Pacific.
                        Meeting one evening in the St. Nicholas Hotel, Carnegie said: ﬁGood evening, Mr. Pullman, aren™t
                        we making a couple of fools of ourselves?ﬂ</p>
                    <p>84</p>
                    <p>ﬁWhat do you mean.?" Pullman demanded.</p>
                    <p>
                        Then Carnegie expressed what he had on his mind - a merger of their two interests. He pictured
                        in glowing terms the mutual advantages of working with, instead of against, each other. Pullman
                        listened attentively, but he was not wholly convinced. Finally he asked, ﬁWhat would you call
                        the new company?ﬂ and Carnegie replied promptly: ﬁWhy, the Pullman Palace Car Company, of
                        course.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        Pullman™s face brightened. ﬁCome into my room,ﬂ he said. ﬁLet™s talk it over.ﬂ That talk made
                        industrial history.</p>
                    <p>
                        This policy of remembering and honoring the names of his friends and business associates was one
                        of the secrets of Andrew Carnegie™s leadership. He was proud of the fact that he could call many
                        of his factory workers by their first names, and he boasted that while he was personally in
                        charge, no strike ever disturbed his flaming steel mills.</p>
                    <p>
                        Benton Love, chairman of Texas Commerce Banc shares, believes that the bigger a corporation
                        gets, the colder it becomes. " One way to warm it up,ﬂ he said, ﬁis to remember people™s names.
                        The executive who tells me he can™t remember names is at the same time telling me he can™t
                        remember a significant part of his business and is operating on quicksand.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        Karen Kirsech of Rancho Palos Verdes, California, a flight attendant for TWA, made it a practice
                        to learn the names of as many passengers in her cabin as possible and use the name when serving
                        them. This resulted in many compliments on her service expressed both to her directly and to the
                        airline. One passenger wrote: "I haven™t flown TWA for some time, but I™m going to start flying
                        nothing but TWA from now on. You make me feel that your airline has become a very personalized
                        airline and that is important to me.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        People are so proud of their names that they strive to perpetuate them at any cost. Even
                        blustering, hard-boiled old P. T. Barnum, the greatest showman of his time, disappointed because
                        he had no sons to carry on his name, offered his grandson, C. H. Seeley, $25,000 dollars if he
                        would call himself ﬁBarnumﬂ Seeley.</p>
                    <p>
                        For many centuries, nobles and magnates supported artists, musicians and authors so that their
                        creative works would be dedicated to them.</p>
                    <p>85</p>
                    <p>Libraries and museums owe their richest collections to people who cannot bear to think that their
                        names might perish from the memory of the race. The New York Public Library has its Astor and
                        Lenox collections. The Metropolitan Museum perpetuates the names of Benjamin Altman and J. P.
                        Morgan. And nearly every church is beautified by stained-glass windows commemorating the names
                        of their donors. Many of the buildings on the campus of most universities bear the names of
                        donors who contributed large sums of money for this honor.</p>
                    <p>
                        Most people don™t remember names, for the simple reason that they don™t take the time and energy
                        necessary to concentrate and repeat and fix names indelibly in their minds. They make excuses
                        for themselves; they are too busy. But they were probably no busier than Franklin D. Roosevelt,
                        and he took time to remember and recall even the names of mechanics with whom he came into
                        contact.</p>
                    <p>
                        To illustrate: The Chrysler organization built a special car for Mr. Roosevelt, who could not
                        use a standard car because his legs were paralyzed. W. F. Chamberlain and a mechanic delivered
                        it to the White House. I have in front of me a letter from Mr. Chamberlain relating his
                        experiences. "I taught President Roosevelt how to handle a car with a lot of unusual gadgets,
                        but he taught me a lot about the fine art of handling people.</p>
                    <p>
                        "When I called at the White House,ﬂ Mr. Chamberlain writes, ﬁthe President was extremely
                        pleasant and cheerful. He called me by name, made me feel very comfortable, and particularly
                        impressed me with the fact that he was vitally interested in things I had to show him and tell
                        him. The car was so designed that it could be operated entirely by hand. A crowd gathered around
                        to look at the car; and he remarked: ‚I think it is marvelous. All you have to do is to touch a
                        button and it moves away and you can drive it without effort. I think it is grand - I don™t know
                        what makes it go. I™d love to have the time to tear it down and see how it works.™</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁWhen Roosevelt™s friends and associates admired the machine, he said in their presence: ‚Mr.
                        Chamberlain, I certainly appreciate all the time and effort you have spent in developing this
                        car. It is a mighty fine job.™ He admired the radiator, the special rear-vision mirror and
                        clock, the special spotlight, the kind of upholstery, the sitting position of the driver™s seat,
                        the special suitcases in the trunk with his monogram on each suitcase. In other words, he took
                        notice of every detail to which he knew I had given considerable thought. He made a point of
                        bringing these various pieces of equipment to the attention of Mrs. Roosevelt, Miss Perkins, the
                        86</p>
                    <p>Secretary of Labor, and his secretary. He even brought the old White House porter into the
                        picture by saying, ‚George, you want to take particularly good care of the suitcases.™</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁWhen the driving lesson was finished, the President turned to me and said: ‚Well, Mr.
                        Chamberlain, I have been keeping the Federal Reserve Board waiting thirty minutes. I guess I had
                        better get back to work.™</p>
                    <p>
                        "I took a mechanic with me to the White House. He was introduced to Roosevelt when he arrived.
                        He didn™t talk to the President, and Roosevelt heard his name only once. He was a shy chap, and
                        he kept in the background. But before leaving us, the President looked for the mechanic, shook
                        his hand, called him by name, and thanked him for coming to Washington. And there was nothing
                        perfunctory about his thanks. He meant what he said. I could feel that.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁA few days after returning to New York, I got an autographed photograph of President Roosevelt
                        and a little note of thanks again expressing his appreciation for my assistance. How he found
                        time to do it is a mystery to me ."</p>
                    <p>
                        Franklin D. Roosevelt knew that one of the simplest, most obvious and most important ways of
                        gaining good will was by remembering names and making people feel important - yet how many of us
                        do it?</p>
                    <p>
                        Half the time we are introduced to a stranger, we chat a few minutes and can™t even remember his
                        or her name by the time we say goodbye.</p>
                    <p>
                        One of the first lessons a politician learns is this: ﬁTo recall a voter™s name is
                        statesmanship. To forget it is oblivion.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        And the ability to remember names is almost as important in business and social contacts as it
                        is in politics.</p>
                    <p>Napoleon the Third, Emperor of France and nephew of the great Napoleon, boasted that in spite of
                        all his royal duties he could remember the name of every person he met.</p>
                    <p>
                        His technique? Simple. If he didn™t hear the name distinctly, he said, ﬁSo sorry. I didn™t get
                        the name clearly.ﬂ Then, if it was an unusual name, he would say, ﬁHow is it spelled?ﬂ 87</p>
                    <p>
                        During the conversation, he took the trouble to repeat the name several times, and tried to
                        associate it in his mind with the person™s features, expression and general appearance.</p>
                    <p>
                        If the person was someone of importance, Napoleon went to even further pains. As soon as His
                        Royal Highness was alone, he wrote the name down on a piece of paper, looked at it, concentrated
                        on it, fixed it securely in his mind, and then tore up the paper. In this way, he gained an eye
                        impression of the name as well as an ear impression.</p>
                    <p>
                        All this takes time, but ﬁGood manners,ﬂ said Emerson, "are made up of petty sacrifices.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        The importance of remembering and using names is not just the prerogative of kings and corporate
                        executives. It works for all of us. Ken Nottingham, an employee of General Motors in Indiana,
                        usually had lunch at the company cafeteria. He noticed that the woman who worked behind the
                        counter always had a scowl on her face. ﬁShe had been making sandwiches for about two hours and
                        I was just another sandwich to her. I told her what I wanted. She weighed out the ham on a
                        little scale, then she gave me one leaf of lettuce, a few potato chips and handed them to
                        me.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁThe next day I went through the same line. Same woman, same scowl. The only difference was I
                        noticed her name tag. I smiled and said, ‚Hello, Eunice,™ and then told her what I wanted. Well,
                        she forgot the scale, piled on the ham, gave me three leaves of lettuce and heaped on the potato
                        chips until they fell off the plate.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        We should be aware of the magic contained in a name and realize that this single item is wholly
                        and completely owned by the person with whom we are dealing and nobody else. The name sets the
                        individual apart; it makes him or her unique among all others. The information we are imparting
                        or the request we are making takes on a special importance when we approach the situation with
                        the name of the individual. From the waitress to the senior executive, the name will work magic
                        as we deal with others.</p>

                        PRINCIPLE 3 - Remember that a person™s name is to that person the sweetest and most important

                        4 - AN EASY WAY TO BECOME A GOOD CONVERSATIONALIST</p>
                    <p>
                        Some time ago, I attended a bridge party. I don™t play bridge - and there was a woman there who
                        didn™t play bridge either. She had discovered that I had once been Lowell Thomas™ manager before
                        he went on the radio and that I had traveled in Europe a great deal while helping him prepare
                        the illustrated travel talks he was then delivering. So she said: ﬁOh, Mr. Carnegie, I do want
                        you to tell me about all the wonderful places you have visited and the sights you have
                        seen.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        As we sat down on the sofa, she remarked that she and her husband had recently returned from a
                        trip to Africa. ﬁAfrica!ﬂ I exclaimed. ﬁHow interesting! I™ve always wanted to see Africa, but I
                        never got there except for a twenty-four-hour stay once in Algiers. Tell me, did you visit the
                        big-game country? Yes? How fortunate. I envy you. Do tell me about Africa.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        That kept her talking for forty-five minutes. She never again asked me where I had been or what
                        I had seen. She didn™t want to hear me talk about my travels. All she wanted was an interested
                        listener, so she could expand her ego and tell about where she had been.</p>
                    <p>
                        Was she unusual? No. Many people are like that.</p>
                    <p>
                        For example, I met a distinguished botanist at a dinner party given by a New York book
                        publisher. I had never talked with a botanist before, and I found him fascinating. I literally
                        sat on the edge of my chair and listened</p>
                    <p>while he spoke of exotic plants and experiments in developing new forms of plant life and indoor
                        gardens (and even told me astonishing facts about the humble potato). I had a small indoor
                        garden of my own - and he was good enough to tell me how to solve some of my problems.</p>
                    <p>As I said, we were at a dinner party. There must have been a dozen other guests, but I violated
                        all the canons of courtesy, ignored everyone else, and talked for hours to the botanist.</p>
                    <p>
                        Midnight came, I said good night to everyone and departed. The botanist then turned to our host
                        and paid me several flattering compliments. I was ﬁmost stimulating.ﬂ I was this and I was that,
                        and he ended by saying I was a ﬁmost interesting conversationalist.ﬂ 89</p>
                    <p>
                        An interesting conversationalist? Why, I had said hardly anything at all. I couldn™t have said
                        anything if I had wanted to without changing the subject, for I didn™t know any more about
                        botany than I knew about the anatomy of a penguin. But I had done this: I had listened intently.
                        I had listened because I was genuinely interested. And he felt it. Naturally that pleased him.
                        That kind of listening is one of the highest compliments we can pay anyone. ﬁFew human beings,ﬂ
                        wrote Jack Woodford in Strangers in Love, ﬁfew human beings are proof against the implied
                        flattery of rapt attention.ﬂ I went even further than giving him rapt attention. I was ﬁhearty
                        in my approbation and lavish in my praise.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        I told him that I had been immensely entertained and instructed - and I had. I told him I wished
                        I had his knowledge - and I did. I told him that I should love to wander the fields with him -
                        and I have. I told him I must see him again - and I did.</p>
                    <p>
                        And so I had him thinking of me as a good conversationalist when, in reality, I had been merely
                        a good listener and had encouraged him to talk.</p>
                    <p>What is the secret, the mystery, of a successful business</p>
                    <p>interview? Well, according to former Harvard president Charles W. Eliot, ﬁThere is no mystery
                        about successful business intercourse. . . . Exclusive attention to the person who is speaking
                        to you is very important. Nothing else is so flattering as that.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        Eliot himself was a past master of the art of listening, Henry James, one of America™s first
                        great novelists, recalled: ﬁDr. Eliot™s listening was not mere silence, but a form of activity.
                        Sitting very erect on the end of his spine with hands joined in his lap, making no movement
                        except that he revolved his thumbs around each other faster or slower, he faced his interlocutor
                        and seemed to be hearing with his eyes as well as his ears. He listened with his mind and
                        attentively considered what you had to say while you said it. . . . At the end of an interview
                        the person who had talked to him felt that he had had his say.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        Self-evident, isn™t it? You don™t have to study for four years in Harvard to discover that. Yet
                        I know and you know department store owners who will rent expensive space, buy their goods
                        economically, dress their windows appealingly, spend thousands of dollars in advertising and
                        then hire clerks who haven™t the sense to be good listeners - clerks who interrupt customers,
                        contradict them, irritate them, and all but drive them from the store.</p>
                    <p>90</p>
                    <p>A department store in Chicago almost lost a regular customer who spent several thousand dollars
                        each year in that store because a sales clerk wouldn™t listen. Mrs. Henrietta Douglas, who took
                        our course in Chicago, had purchased a coat at a special sale. After she had brought it home she
                        noticed that there was a tear in the lining. She came back the next day and asked the sales
                        clerk to exchange it. The clerk refused even to listen to her complaint. ﬁYou bought this at a
                        special sale,ﬂ she said. She pointed to a sign on the wall. ﬁRead that,ﬂ she exclaimed." 'All
                        sales are final.' Once you bought it, you have to keep it. Sew up the lining yourself.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁBut this was damaged merchandise,ﬂ Mrs. Douglas complained.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁMakes no difference,ﬂ the clerk interrupted. ﬁFinal™s final "</p>
                    <p>
                        Mrs. Douglas was about to walk out indignantly, swearing never to return to that store ever,
                        when she was greeted by the department manager, who knew her from her many years of patronage.
                        Mrs. Douglas told her what had happened.</p>
                    <p>
                        The manager listened attentively to the whole story, examined the coat and then said: ﬁSpecial
                        sales are ‚final™ so we can dispose of merchandise at the end of the season. But this 'no
                        return™ policy does not apply to damaged goods. We will certainly repair or replace the lining,
                        or if you prefer, give you your money back.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        What a difference in treatment! If that manager had not come along and listened to the Customer,
                        a long-term patron of that store could have been lost forever.</p>
                    <p>
                        Listening is just as important in one's home life as in the world of business. Millie Esposito
                        of Croton-on-Hudson, New York, made it her business to listen carefully when one of her children
                        wanted to speak with her. One evening she was sitting in the kitchen with her son, Robert, and
                        after a brief discussion of something that was on his mind, Robert said: "Mom, I know that you
                        love me very much.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        Mrs. Esposito was touched and said: ﬁOf course I love you very much. Did you doubt it?ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        Robert responded: "No, but I really know you love me because whenever I want to talk to you
                        about something you stop whatever you are doing and listen to me.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        The chronic kicker, even the most violent critic, will frequently soften and be subdued in the
                        presence of a patient, sympathetic listener - a listener who will he 91</p>
                    <p>silent</p>
                    <p>while the irate fault-finder dilates like a king cobra and spews the poison out of his system. To
                        illustrate: The New York Telephone Company discovered a few years ago that it had to deal with
                        one of the most vicious customers who ever cursed a customer service representative. And he did
                        curse. He raved. He threatened to tear the phone out by its roots. He refused to pay certain
                        charges that he declared were false. He wrote letters to the newspapers. He filed innumerable
                        complaints with the Public Service Commission, and he started several suits against the
                        telephone company.</p>
                    <p>
                        At last, one of the company™s most skillful ﬁtrouble-shootersﬂ was sent to interview this stormy
                        petrel. This ﬁtroubleshooterﬂ listened and let the cantankerous customer enjoy himself pouring
                        out his tirade. The telephone representative listened and said ﬁyesﬂ and sympathized with his
                        grievance.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁHe raved on and I listened for nearlv three hours,ﬂ the ﬁtroubleshooterﬂ said as he related his
                        experiences before one of the author™s classes. ﬁThen I went back and listened some more. I
                        interviewed him four times, and before the fourth visit was over I had become a charter member
                        of an organization he was starting. He called it the ‚Telephone Subscribers™ Protective
                        Association.' I am still a member of this organization, and, so far as I know, I™m the only
                        member in the world today besides Mr. ----.</p>
                    <p>
                        "I listened and sympathized with him on every point that he made during these interviews. He had
                        never had a telephone representative talk with him that way before, and he became almost
                        friendly. The point on which I went to see him was not even mentioned on the first visit, nor
                        was it mentioned on the second or third, but upon the fourth interview, I closed the case
                        completely, he paid all his bills in full, and for the first time in the history of his
                        difficulties with the telephone company he voluntarily withdrew his complaints from the Public
                        Service Commission.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        Doubtless Mr. ----- had considered himself a holy crusader, defending the public rights against
                        callous exploitation. But in reality, what he had really wanted was a feeling of importance. He
                        got this feeling of importance at first by kicking and complaining. But as soon as he got his
                        feeling of importance from a representative of the company, his imagined grievances vanished
                        into thin air.</p>
                    <p>
                        One morning years ago, an angry customer stormed into the office of Julian F. Detmer, founder of
                        the Detmer Woolen Company, which later became the world™s 92</p>
                    <p>largest distributor of woolens to the tailoring trade.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁThis man owed us a small sum of money,ﬂ Mr. Detmer explained to me. ﬁThe customer denied it,
                        but we knew he was wrong. So our credit department had insisted that he pay. After getting a
                        number of letters from our credit department, he packed his grip, made a trip to Chicago, and
                        hurried into my office to inform me not only that he was not going to pay that bill, but that he
                        was never going to buy another dollar™s worth of goods from the Detmer Woolen Company.</p>
                    <p>
                        "I listened patiently to all he had to say. I was tempted to interrupt, but I realized that
                        would be bad policy, So I let him talk himself out. When he finally simmered down and got in a
                        receptive mood, I said quietly: ‚I want to thank vou for coming to Chicago to tell me about
                        this. You have done me a great favor, for if our credit department has annoyed you, it may annoy
                        other good customers, and that would be just too bad. Believe me, I am far more eager to hear
                        this than you are to tell it.™</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁThat was the last thing in the world he expected me to say. I think he was a trifle
                        disappointed, because he had come to Chicago to tell me a thing or two, but here I was thanking
                        him instead of scrapping with him. I assured</p>
                    <p>him we would wipe the charge off the books and forget it, because he was a very careful man with
                        only one account to look after, while our clerks had to look after thousands. Therefore, he was
                        less likely to be wrong than we were.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁI told him that I understood exactly how he felt and that, if I were in his shoes, I should
                        undoubtedly feel precisely as he did. Since he wasn™t going to buy from us anymore, I
                        recommended some other woolen houses.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁIn the past, we had usually lunched together when he came to Chicago, so I invited him to have
                        lunch with me this day. He accepted reluctantly, but when we came back to the office he placed a
                        larger order than ever before. He returned home in a softened mood and, wanting to be just as
                        fair with us as we had been with him, looked over his bills, found one that had been mislaid,
                        and sent us a check with his apologies.</p>

                        "Later, when his wife presented him with a baby boy, he gave his son the middle name of Detmer,
                        and he remained a friend and customer of the house until his death twenty-two years
                        afterwards.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>Years ago, a poor Dutch immigrant boy washed the windows of a bakery shop after 93</p>
                    <p>school to help support his family. His people were so poor that in addition he used to go out in
                        the street with a basket every day and collect stray bits of coal that had fallen in the gutter
                        where the coal wagons had delivered fuel. That boy, Edward Bok, never got more than six years of
                        schooling in his life; yet eventually he made himself one of the most successful magazine
                        editors in the history of American journalism. How did he do it? That is a long story, but how
                        he got his start can be told briefly. He got his start by using the principles advocated in this
                        chapter.</p>
                    <p>
                        He left school when he was thirteen and became an office boy for Western Union, but he didn™t
                        for one moment give up the idea of an education. Instead, he started to educate himself, He
                        saved his carfares and went without lunch until he had enough money to buy an encyclopedia of
                        American biography - and then he did an unheard-of thing. He read the lives of famous people and
                        wrote them asking for additional information about their childhoods. He was a good listener. He
                        asked famous people to tell him more about themselves. He wrote General James A. Garfield, who
                        was then running for President, and asked if it was true that he was once a tow boy on a canal;
                        and Garfield replied. He wrote General Grant asking about a certain battle, and Grant drew a map
                        for him and invited this fourteen-year old boy to dinner and spent the evening talking to
                        him.</p>
                    <p>
                        Soon our Western Union messenger boy was corresponding with many of the most famous people in
                        the nation: Ralph Waldo Emerson, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Longfellow, Mrs. Abraham Lincoln, Louisa
                        May Alcott, General Sherman and Jefferson Davis. Not only did he correspond with these
                        distinguished people, but as soon as he got a vacation, he visited many of them as a welcome
                        guest in their homes. This experience imbued him with a confidence that was invaluable. These
                        men and women fired him with a vision and ambition that shaped his life. And all this, let me
                        repeat, was made possible solely by the application of the principles we are discussing
                        here.</p>
                    <p>
                        Isaac F. Marcosson, a journalist who interviewed hundreds of celebrities, declared that many
                        people fail to make a favorable impression because they don™t listen attentively. ﬁThey have
                        been so much concerned with what they are going to say next that they do not keep their ears
                        open. . . . Very important people have told me that they prefer good listeners to good talkers,
                        but the ability to listen seems rarer than almost any other good trait ."</p>
                    <p>
                        And not only important personages crave a good listener, but ordinary folk do too. As the
                        Reader™s Digest once said: ﬁMany persons call a doctor when all they want 94</p>
                    <p>is an audience,ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        During the darkest hours of the Civil War, Lincoln wrote to an old friend in Springfield,
                        Illinois, asking him to come to Washington. Lincoln said he had some problems he wanted to
                        discuss with him. The old neighbor called at the White House, and Lincoln talked to him for
                        hours about the advisability of issuing a proclamation freeing the slaves. Lincoln went over all
                        the arguments for and against such a move, and then read letters and newspaper articles, some
                        denouncing him for not freeing the slaves and others denouncing him for fear he was going to
                        free them. After talking for hours, Lincoln shook hands with his old neighbor, said good night,
                        and sent him back to Illinois without even asking for his opinion. Lincoln had done all the
                        talking himself. That seemed to clarify his mind. ﬁHe seemed to feel easier after that talk,ﬂ
                        the old friend said. Lincoln hadn™t wanted advice, He had wanted merely a friendly, sympathetic
                        listener to whom he could unburden himself. That™s what we all want when we are in trouble. That
                        is frequently all the irritated customer wants, and the dissatisfied employee or the hurt
                        friend.</p>
                    <p>
                        One of the great listeners of modern times was Sigmund Freud. A man who met Freud described his
                        manner of listening: ﬁIt struck me so forcibly that I shall never forget him. He had qualities
                        which I had never seen in any other man. Never had I seen such concentrated attention. There was
                        none of that piercing ‚soul penetrating gaze™ business. His eyes were mild and genial. His voice
                        was low and kind. His gestures were few. But the attention he gave me, his appreciation of what
                        I said, even when I said it badly, was extraordinary, You've no idea what it meant to be
                        listened to like that.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        If you want to know how to make people shun you and laugh at you behind your back and even
                        despise you, here is the recipe: Never listen to anyone for long. Talk incessantly about
                        yourself. If you have an idea while the other person is talking, don™t wait for him or her to
                        finish: bust right in and interrupt in the middle of a sentence.</p>
                    <p>
                        Do you know people like that? I do, unfortunately; and the astonishing part of it is that some
                        of them are prominent.</p>
                    <p>
                        Bores, that is all they are - bores intoxicated with their own egos, drunk with a sense of their
                        own importance.</p>
                    <p> People who talk only of themselves think only of themselves. And ﬁthose people 95</p>
                    <p>who think only of themselves,ﬂ Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler, longtime president of Columbia
                        University, said, "are hopelessly uneducated. They are not educated,ﬂ said Dr. Butler, ﬁno
                        matter how instructed they may be.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        So if you aspire to be a good conversationalist, be an attentive listener. To be interesting, be
                        interested. Ask questions that other persons will enjoy answering. Encourage them to talk about
                        themselves and their accomplishments.</p>
                    <p>
                        Remember that the people you are talking to are a hundred times more interested in themselves
                        and their wants and problems than they are in you and your problems. A person™s toothache means
                        more to that person than a famine in China which kills a million people. A boil on one™s neck
                        interests one more than forty earthquakes in Africa. Think of that the next time you start a
                        conversation.</p>
                    <p>PRINCIPLE 4 - Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves.</p>

                        Everyone who was ever a guest of Theodore Roosevelt was astonished at the range and diversity of
                        his knowledge. Whether his visitor was a cowboy or a Rough Rider, a New York politician or a
                        diplomat, Roosevelt knew what to say. And how was it done? The answer was simple. Whenever
                        Roosevelt expected a visitor, he sat up late the night before, reading up on the subject in
                        which he knew his guest was particularly interested.</p>
                    <p>
                        For Roosevelt knew, as all leaders know, that the royal road to a person™s heart is to talk
                        about the things he or she treasures most.</p>
                    <p>
                        The genial William Lyon Phelps, essayist and professor of literature at Yale, learned this
                        lesson early in life.</p>
                    <p>
                        "When I was eight years old and was spending a weekend visiting my Aunt Libby Linsley at her
                        home in Stratford on the Housatonic,ﬂ he wrote in his essay on Human Nature, ﬁa middle-aged man
                        called one evening, and after a polite skirmish with my aunt, he devoted his attention to me. At
                        that time, I happened to be excited about boats, and the visitor discussed the subject in a way
                        that seemed to me particularly interesting. After he left, I spoke of him with enthusiasm. What
                        a man! My aunt informed me he was a New York lawyer, that he cared nothing whatever about boats
                        - that he took not the slightest interest in the subject. ‚But why then did he talk all the time
                        about boats?™</p>
                    <p>
                        " ‚Because he is a gentleman. He saw you were interested in boats, and he talked about the
                        things he knew would interest and please you. He made himself agreeable.™ "</p>
                    <p>
                        And William Lyon Phelps added: "I never forgot my aunt™s remark.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        As I write this chapter, I have before me a letter from Edward L. Chalif, who was active in Boy
                        Scout work.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁOne day I found I needed a favor,ﬂ wrote Mr. Chalif. ﬁA big Scout jamboree was coming off in
                        Europe, and I wanted the president of one of the largest corporations in America to pay the
                        expenses of one of my boys for the trip.</p>
                    <p>ﬁFortunately, just before I went to see this man, I heard that he had drawn a check 97</p>
                    <p>for a million dollars, and that after it was canceled, he had had it framed.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁSo the first thing I did when I entered his office was to ask to see the check. A check for a
                        million dollars! I told him I never knew that anybody had ever written such a check, and that I
                        wanted to tell my boys that I had actually seen a check for a million dollars. He gladly showed
                        it to me; I admired it and asked him to tell me all about how it happened to be drawn.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        You notice, don™t you, that Mr. Chalif didn™t begin by talking about the Boy Scouts, or the
                        jamboree in Europe, or what it was he wanted? He talked in terms of what interested the other
                        man. Here™s the result:</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁPresently, the man I was interviewing said: ‚Oh, by the way, what was it you wanted to see me
                        about?™ So I told him.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁTo my vast surprise,ﬂ Mr. Chalif continues, ﬁhe not only granted immediately what I asked for,
                        but much more. I had asked him to send only one boy to Europe, but he sent five boys and myself,
                        gave me a letter of credit for a thousand dollars and told us to stay in Europe for seven weeks.
                        He also gave me letters of introduction to his branch presidents, putting them at our service,
                        and he himself met us in Paris and showed us the town.</p>
                    <p>
                        Since then, he has given jobs to some of the boys whose parents were in want, and he is still
                        active in our group.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁYet I know if I hadn™t found out what he was interested in, and got him warmed up first, I
                        wouldn™t have found him one-tenth as easy to approach.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        Is this a valuable technique to use in business? Is it? Let™s see, Take Henry G. Duvernoy of
                        Duvemoy and Sons, a wholesale baking firm in New York.</p>
                    <p>
                        Mr. Duvernoy had been trying to sell bread to a certain New York hotel. He had called on the
                        manager every week for four years. He went to the same social affairs the manager attended. He
                        even took rooms in the hotel and lived there in order to get the business. But he failed.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁThen,ﬂ said Mr. Duvernoy, ﬁafter studying human relations, I resolved to change my tactics. I
                        decided to find out what interested this man - what caught his enthusiasm. 98</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁI discovered he belonged to a society of hotel executives called the Hotel Greeters of America.
                        He not only belonged, but his bubbling enthusiasm had made him president of the organization,
                        and president of the International Greeters. No matter where its conventions were held, he would
                        be there.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁSo when I saw him the next day, I began talking about the Greeters. What a response I got. What
                        a response! He talked to me for half an hour about the Greeters, his tones vibrant with
                        enthusiasm. I could plainly see that this society was not only his hobby, it was the passion of
                        his life. Before I left his office, he had ‚sold™ me a membership in his organization.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁIn the meantime, I had said nothing about bread. But a few days later, the steward of his hotel
                        phoned me to come over with samples and prices.</p>
                    <p>
                        " ‚I don™t know what you did to the old boy,™ the steward greeted me, ‚but he sure is sold on
                        you!™</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁThink of it! I had been drumming at that man for four years - trying to get his business - and
                        I™d still be drumming at him if I hadn™t finally taken the trouble to find out what he was
                        interested in, and what he enjoyed talking about.ﬂ</p>

                        Edward E. Harriman of Hagerstown, Maryland, chose to live in the beautiful Cumberland Valley of
                        Maryland after he completed his military service. Unfortunately, at that time there were few
                        jobs available in the area. A little research uncovered the fact that a number of companies in
                        the area were either owned or controlled by an unusual business maverick, R. J. Funkhouser,
                        whose rise from poverty to riches intrigued Mr. Harriman. However, he was known for being
                        inaccessible to job seekers. Mr. Harriman wrote:</p>
                    <p>"I interviewed a number of people and found that his major interest was anchored in his drive for
                        power and money. Since he protected himself from people like me by use of a dedicated and stern
                        secretary, I studied her interests and goals and only then I paid an unannounced visit at her
                        office. She had been Mr. Funkhouser™s orbiting satellite for about fifteen years. When I told
                        her I had a proposition for him which might translate itself into financial and political
                        success for him, she became enthused. I also conversed with her about her constructive
                        participation in his success. After this conversation she arranged for me to meet Mr.
                        Funkhouser.</p>
                    <p>99</p>
                    <p>ﬁI entered his huge and impressive office determined not to ask directly for a job. He was seated
                        behind a large carved desk and thundered at me, ‚How about it, young man?' I said, ‚Mr.
                        Funkhouser, I believe I can make money for you.™ He immediately rose and invited me to sit in
                        one of the large upholstered chairs. I enumerated my ideas and the qualifications I had to
                        realize these ideas, as well a</p>
                    <p>how they would contribute to his personal success and that of his businesses.</p>

                        Talking in terms of the other person™s interests pays off for both parties. Howard Z. Herzig, a
                        leader in the field of employee communications, has always followed this principle. When asked
                        what reward he got from it, Mr. Herzig responded that he not only received a different reward
                        from each person but that in general the reward had been an enlargement of his life each time he
                        spoke to someone.</p>

                    <p>6 - HOW TO MAKE PEOPLE LIKE YOU INSTANTLY</p>
                    <p>

                        I was waiting in line to register a letter in the post office at Thirty-third Street and Eighth
                        Avenue in New York. I noticed that the clerk appeared to be bored with the jobŠweighing
                        envelopes, handing out stamps, making change, issuing receiptsŠthe same monotonous grind year
                        after year. So I said to myself: "I am going to try to make that clerk like me. Obviously, to
                        make him like me, I must say something nice, not about myself, but about him. So I asked myself,
                        ‚What is there about him that I can honestly admire?™ " That is sometimes a hard question to
                        answer, especially with strangers; but, in this case, it happened to be easy. I instantly saw
                        something I admired no end.</p>
                    <p>
                        So while he was weighing my envelope, I remarked with enthusiasm: "I certainly wish I had your
                        head of hair.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        He looked up, half-startled, his face beaming with smiles. "Well, it isn™t as good as it used to
                        be,ﬂ he said modestly. I assured him that although it might have lost some of its pristine
                        glory, nevertheless it was still magnificent. He was immensely pleased. We carried on a pleasant
                        little conversation and the last thing he said to me was: ﬁMany people have admired my
                        hair.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        I™ll bet that person went out to lunch that day walking on air. I™ll bet he went home that night
                        and told his wife about it. I™ll bet he looked in the mirror and said: ﬁIt is a beautiful head
                        of hair.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        I told this story once in public and a man asked me afterwards: ﬁ‚What did you want to get out
                        of him?ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        What was I trying to get out of him!!! What was I trying to get out of him!!!</p>
                    <p>
                        If we are so contemptibly selfish that we can™t radiate a little happiness and pass on a bit of
                        honest appreciation without trying to get something out of the other person in return - if our
                        souls are no bigger than sour crab apples, we shall meet with the failure we so richly deserve.
                        Oh yes, I did want something out of that chap. I wanted something priceless. And I got it. I got
                        the feeling that I had done something for him without his being able to do anything whatever in
                        return for me. That is a feeling that flows and sings in your memory lung after the incident is
                        past.</p>
                    <p>101</p>
                    <p>There is one all-important law of human conduct. If we obey that law, we shall almost never get
                        into trouble. In fact, that law, if obeyed, will bring us countless friends and constant
                        happiness. But the very instant we break the law, we shall get into endless trouble. The law is
                        this: Always make the other person feel important. John Dewey, as we have already noted, said
                        that the desire to be important is the deepest urge in human nature; and William James said:
                        ﬁThe deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be appreciated.ﬂ As I have already
                        pointed out, it is this urge that differentiates us from the animals. It is this urge that has
                        been responsible for civilization itself.</p>
                    <p>
                        Philosophers have been speculating on the rules of human relationships for thousands of years,
                        and out of all that speculation, there has evolved only one important precept. It is not new. It
                        is as old as history. Zoroaster taught it to his followers in Persia twenty-five hundred years
                        ago. Confucius preached it in China twenty-four centuries ago. Lao-tse, the founder of Taoism,
                        taught it to his disciples in the Valley of the Han. Buddha preached it on the bank of the Holy
                        Ganges five hundred years before Christ. The sacred books of Hinduism taught it a thousand years
                        before that. Jesus taught it among the stony hills of Judea nineteen centuries ago. Jesus summed
                        it up in one thoughtŠprobably the most important rule in the world: ﬁDo unto others as you would
                        have others do unto you.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        You want the approval of those with whom you come in contact. You want recognition of your true
                        worth. You want a feeling that you are important in your little world. You don™t want to listen
                        to cheap, insincere flattery, but you do crave sincere appreciation. You want your friends and
                        associates to be, as Charles Schwab put it, ﬁhearty in their approbation and lavish in their
                        praise.ﬂ All of us want that.</p>
                    <p>
                        So let™s obey the Golden Rule, and give unto others what we would have others give unto us, How?
                        When? Where? The answer is: All the time, everywhere.</p>
                    <p>
                        David G. Smith of Eau Claire, Wisconsin, told one of our classes how he handled a delicate
                        situation when he was asked to take charge of the refreshment booth at a charity concert,</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁThe night of the concert I arrived at the park and found two elderly ladies in a very bad humor
                        standing next to the refreshment stand. Apparently each thought that she was in charge of this
                        project. As I stood there pondering what to do, me of the members of the sponsoring committee
                        appeared and handed me a cash box and 102</p>
                    <p>thanked me for taking over the project. She introduced Rose and Jane as my helpers and then ran
                        off.</p>
                    <p>
                        "A great silence ensued. Realizing that the cash box was a symbol of authority (of sorts), I
                        gave the box to Rose and explained that I might not be able to keep the money straight and that
                        if she took care of it I would feel better. I then suggested to Jane that she show two teenagers
                        who had been assigned to refreshments how to operate the soda machine, and I asked her to be
                        responsible for that part of the project.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁThe evening was very enjoyable with Rose happily counting the money, Jane supervising the
                        teenagers, and me enjoying the concert.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        You don™t have to wait until you are ambassador to France or chairman of the Clambake Committee
                        of your lodge before you use this philosophy of appreciation. You can work magic with it almost
                        every day.</p>
                    <p>
                        If, for example, the waitress brings us mashed potatoes when we have ordered French fried, let™s
                        say: ﬁI™m sorry to trouble you, but I prefer French fried.ﬂ She™ll probably reply, ﬁNo trouble
                        at allﬂ and will be glad to change the potatoes, because we have shown respect for her.</p>
                    <p>
                        Little phrases such as ﬁI™m sorry to trouble you,ﬂ ﬁWould you be so kind as to ----? " "Won't
                        you please?ﬂ " Would you mind?ﬂ ﬁThank youﬂ - little courtesies like these oil the cogs of the
                        monotonous grind of everyday lifeŠand, incidentally, they are the hallmark of good breeding.</p>
                    <p>
                        Let™s take another illustration. Hall Caine™s novelsŠThe Christian, The Deemster, The Manxman,
                        among themŠwere all best-sellers in the early part of this century. Millions of people read his
                        novels, countless millions. He was the son of a blacksmith. He never had more than eight years™
                        schooling in his life; yet when he died he was the richest literary man of his time.</p>
                    <p>The story goes like this: Hall Caine loved sonnets and ballads; so he devoured all of Dante
                        Gabriel Rossetti™s poetry. He even wrote a lecture chanting the praises of Rossetti™s artistic
                        achievement-and sent a copy to Rossetti himself. Rossetti was delighted. ﬁAny young man who has
                        such an exalted opinion of my ability,ﬂ Rossetti probably said to himself, ﬁmust be brilliant,ﬂ
                        So Rossetti invited this blacksmith™s son to come to London and act as his secretary. That was
                        the turning 103</p>
                    <p>point in Hall Caine™s life; for, in his new position, he met the literary artists of the day.
                        Profiting by their advice and inspired by their encouragement, he launched upon a career that
                        emblazoned his name across the sky.</p>
                    <p>
                        His home, Greeba Castle, on the Isle of Man, became a Mecca for tourists from the far corners of
                        the world, and he left a multimillion dollar estate. YetŠwho knowsŠhe might have died poor and
                        unknown had he not written an essay expressing his admiration for a famous man.</p>
                    <p>
                        Such is the power, the stupendous power, of sincere, heartfelt appreciation.</p>
                    <p>
                        Rossetti considered himself important. That is not strange, Almost everyone considers himself
                        important, very important.</p>
                    <p>
                        The life of many a person could probably be changed if only someone would make him feel
                        important. Ronald J. Rowland, who is one of the instructors of our course in California, is also
                        a teacher of arts and crafts. He wrote to us about a student named Chris in his beginning crafts
                        class:</p>
                    <p>
                        Chris was a very quiet, shy boy lacking in self-confidence, the kind of student that often does
                        not receive the attention he deserves. I also teach an advanced class that had grown to be
                        somewhat of a status symbol and a privilege for a student to have earned the right to be in it.
                        On Wednesday, Chris was diligently working at his desk. I really felt there was a hidden fire
                        deep inside him. I asked Chris if he would like to be in the advanced class. How I wish I could
                        express the look in Chris™s face, the emotions in that shy fourteen-year-old boy, trying to hold
                        back his tears.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁWho me, Mr. Rowland? Am I good enough?ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁYes, Chris, you are good enough.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        I had to leave at that point because tears were coming to my eyes. As Chris walked out of class
                        that day, seemingly two inches taller, he looked at me with bright blue eyes and said in a
                        positive voice, ﬁThank you, Mr. Rowland.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        Chris taught me a lesson I will never forget-our deep desire to feel important. To help me never
                        forget this rule, I made a sign which read</p>
                    <p>ﬁYOU ARE IMPORTANT." This sign hangs in the front of the classroom for all to see and to remind
                        me that each student I face is equally important. 104</p>
                    <p>
                        The unvarnished truth is that almost all the people you meet feel themselves superior to you in
                        some way, and a sure way to their hearts is to let them realize in some subtle way that you
                        recognize their importance, and recognize it sincerely.</p>
                    <p>
                        Remember what Emerson said: ﬁEvery man I meet is my superior in some way. In that, I learn of
                        him.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        And the pathetic part of it is that frequently those who have the least justification for a
                        feeling of achievement bolster up their egos by a show of tumult and conceit which is truly
                        nauseating. As Shakespeare put it: ". . . man, proud man, Drest in a little brief authority, . .
                        . Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven, As make the angels weep.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        I am going to tell you how business people in my own courses have applied these principles with
                        remarkable results. Let™s take the case of a Connecticut attorney (because of his relatives he
                        prefers not to have his name mentioned).</p>
                    <p>
                        Shortly after joining the course, Mr. R----- drove to Long Island with his wife to visit some of
                        her relatives. She left him to chat with an old aunt of hers and ther rushed off by herself to
                        visit some of the younger relatives. Since he soon had to give a speech professionally on how he
                        applied the principles of appreciation, he thought he would gain some worthwhile experience
                        talking with the elderly lady. So he looked around the house to see what he could honestly
                        admire.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁThis house was built about 1890, wasn™t it?ﬂ he inquired.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁYes,ﬂ she replied, ﬁthat is precisely the year it was built.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁIt reminds me of the house I was born in,ﬂ he said. ﬁIt™s beautiful. Well built. Roomy. You
                        know, they don™t build houses like this anymore.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁYou™re right,ﬂ the old lady agreed. ﬁThe young folks nowadays don™t care for beautiful homes.
                        All they want is a small apartment, and then they go off gadding about in their automobiles.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁThis is a dream house,ﬂ she said in a voice vibrating with tender memories. ﬁThis house was
                        built with love. My husband and I dreame</p>
                    <p>about it for years before we built it. We didn™t have an architect. We planned it all ourselves."
                        105</p>
                    <p>
                        She showed Mr. R----- about the house, and he expressed his hearty admiration for the beautiful
                        treasures she had picked up in her travels and cherished over a lifetime - paisley shawls, an
                        old English tea set, Wedgwood china, French beds and chairs, Italian paintings, and silk
                        draperies that had once hung in a French chateau.</p>
                    <p>
                        After showing Mr. R----- through the house, she took him out to the garage. There, jacked up on
                        blocks, was a Packard car - in mint condition.</p>
                    <p>
                        "My husband bought that car for me shortly before he passed on,ﬂ she said softly. ﬁI have never
                        ridden in it since his death. . . . You appreciate nice things, and I™m going to give this car
                        to you.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁWhy, aunty,ﬂ he said, ﬁyou overwhelm me. I appreciate your generosity, of course; but I
                        couldn™t possibly accept it. I™m not even a relative of yours. I have a new car, and you have
                        many relatives that would like to have that Packard.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁRelatives!ﬂ she exclaimed. ﬁYes, I have relatives who are just waiting till I die so they can
                        get that car. But they are not going to get it.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁIf you don™t want to give it to them, you can very easily sell it to a secondhand dealer,ﬂ he
                        told her.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁSell it!ﬂ she cried. ﬁDo you think I would sell this car? Do you think I could stand to see
                        strangers riding up and down the street in that car - that car that my husband bought for me? I
                        wouldn™t dream of selling it. I™m going to give it to you. You appreciate beautiful things."</p>
                    <p>
                        He tried to get out of accepting the car, but he couldn™t without hurting her feelings.</p>
                    <p>
                        This lady, left all alone in a big house with her paisley shawls, her French antiques, and her
                        memories, was starving for a little recognition, She had once been young and beautiful and
                        sought after She had once built a house warm with love and had collected things from all over
                        Europe to make it beautiful. Now, in the isolated loneliness of old age, she craved a little
                        human warmth, a little genuine appreciation - and no one gave it to her. And when she found it,
                        like a spring in the desert, her gratitude couldn™t adequately express itself with anything less
                        than the gift of her cherished Packard.</p>
                    <p>106</p>
                    <p>Let™s take another case: Donald M. McMahon, who was superintendent of Lewis and Valentine,
                        nurserymen and landscape architects in Rye, New York, related this incident:</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁShortly after I attended the talk on ‚How to Win Friends and Influence People,™ I was
                        landscaping the estate of a famous attorney. The owner came out to give me a few instructions
                        about where he wished to plant a mass of rhododendrons and azaleas.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁI said, ‚Judge, you have a lovely hobby. I've been admiring your beautiful dogs. I understand
                        you win a lot of blue ribbons every year at the show in Madison Square Garden.™</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁThe effect of this little expression of appreciation was striking.</p>
                    <p>
                        " ‚Yes,™ the judge replied, ‚I do have a lot of fun with my dogs. Would you like to see my
                        kennel?™</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁHe spent almost an hour showing me his dogs and the prizes they had won. He even brought out
                        their pedigrees and explained about the bloodlines responsible for such beauty and
                        intelligence.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁFinally, turning to me, he asked: ‚Do you have any small children?™</p>
                    <p>
                        " ‚Yes, I do,™ I replied, ‚I have a son.™</p>
                    <p>
                        " ‚Well, wouldn™t he like a puppy?™ the judge inquired.</p>
                    <p>
                        " ‚Oh, yes, he™d be tickled pink.™</p>
                    <p>
                        " ‚All right, I™m going to give him one,' the . judge announced.</p>
                    <p>
                        He started to tell me how to feed the puppy. Then he paused. ‚You™ll forget it if I tell you.
                        I™ll write it out.™ So the judge went in the house, typed out the pedigree and feeding
                        instructions, and gave me a puppy worth several hundred dollars and one hour and fifteen minutes
                        of his valuable time largely because I had expressed my honest</p>
                    <p>admiration for his hobby and achievements.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>George Eastman, of Kodak fame, invented the transparent film that made motion 107</p>
                    <p>pictures possible, amassed a fortune of a hundred million dollars, and made himself one of the
                        most famous businessmen on earth. Yet in spite of all these tremendous accomplishments, he
                        craved little recognitions even as you and I.</p>
                    <p>
                        To illustrate: When Eastman was building the Eastman</p>
                    <p>School of Music and also Kilbourn Hall in Rochester,</p>
                    <p>James Adamson, then president of the Superior Seating Company of New York, wanted to get the
                        order to supply the theater chairs for these buildings. Phoning the architect, Mr. Adamson made
                        an appointment to see Mr. Eastman in Rochester.</p>
                    <p>
                        When Adamson arrived, the architect said: "I know you want to get this order, but I can tell you
                        right now that you won™t stand a ghost of a show if you take more than five minutes of George
                        Eastman™s time. He is a strict disciplinarian. He is very busy. So tell your story quickly and
                        get out.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        Adamson was prepared to do just that.</p>
                    <p>
                        When he was ushered into the room he saw Mr. Eastman bending over a pile of papers at his desk.
                        Presently, Mr. Eastman looked up, removed his glasses, and walked toward the architect and Mr.
                        Adamson, saying: ﬁGood morning, gentlemen, what can I do for you?ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        The architect introduced them, and then Mr. Adamson said: ﬁWhile we™ve been waiting for you, Mr.
                        Eastman, I™ve been admiring your office. I wouldn™t mind working in a room like this myself. I™m
                        in the interior-woodworking business, and I never saw a more beautiful office in all my
                        life.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        George Eastman replied: ﬁYou remind me of something I had almost forgotten. It is beautiful,
                        isn™t it? I enjoyed it a great deal when it was first built. But I come down here now with a lot
                        of other things on my mind and sometimes don™t even see the room for weeks at a time ."</p>
                    <p>
                        Adamson walked over and rubbed his hand across a panel. ﬁThis is English oak, isn™t it? A little
                        different texture from Italian oak.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁYes,ﬂ Eastman replied. ﬁImported English oak. It was selected for me by a friend who
                        specializes in fine woods ."</p>
                    <p>Then Eastman showed him about the room, commenting on the proportions, the 108</p>
                    <p>coloring, the hand carving and other effects he had helped to plan and execute.</p>
                    <p>
                        While drifting about the room, admiring the wood-work, they paused before a window, and George
                        Eastman, in his modest, soft-spoken way, pointed out some of the institutions through which he
                        was trying to help humanity: the University of Rochester, the General Hospital, the Homeopathic
                        Hospital, the Friendly Home, the Children™s Hospital. Mr. Adamson congratulated him warmly on
                        the idealistic way he was using his wealth to alleviate the sufferings of humanity. Presently,
                        George Eastman unlocked a glass case and pulle</p>
                    <p>out the first camera he had ever owned - an invention he had bought from an Englishman.</p>
                    <p>
                        Adamson questioned him at length about his early struggles to get started in business, and Mr.
                        Eastman spoke with real feeling about the poverty of his childhood, telling how his widowed
                        mother had kept a boardinghouse while he clerked in an insurance office. The terror of poverty
                        haunted him day and night, and he resolved to make enough money so that his mother wouldn™t have
                        to work, Mr. Adamson drew him out with further questions and listened, absorbed, while he
                        related the story of his experiments with dry photographic plates. He told how he had worked in
                        an office all day, and sometimes experimented all night, taking only brief naps while the
                        chemicals were working, sometimes working and sleeping in his clothes for seventy-two hours at a
                        stretch.</p>
                    <p>
                        James Adamson had been ushered into Eastman™s office at ten-fifteen and had been warned that he
                        must not take more than five minutes; but an hour had passed, then two hours passed. And they
                        were still talking. Finally, George Eastman turned to Adamson and said, ﬁThe last time I was in
                        Japan I bought some chairs, brought them home, and put them in my sun porch. But the sun peeled
                        the paint, so I went downtown the other day and bought some paint and painted the chairs myself.
                        Would you like to see what sort of a job I can do painting chairs? All right. Come up to my home
                        and have lunch with me and I™ll show you.ﬂ</p>
                    <p>
                        After lunch, Mr. Eastman showed Adamson the chairs he had brought from Japan. They weren™t worth
                        more than a few dollars, but George Eastman, now a multimillionaire, was proud of them because
                        he himself had painted them.</p>
                    <p>
                        The order for the seats amounted to $90,000. Who do you suppose got the order - James Adamson or
                        one of his competitors?</p>
                    <p>From the time of this story until Mr. Eastman™s death, he and James Adamson were 109</p>
                    <p>close friends.</p>
                    <p>
                        Claude Marais, a restaurant owner in Rouen, France, used this principle and saved his restaurant
                        the loss of a key employee. This woman had been in his employ for five years and was a vital
                        link between M. Marais and his staff of twenty-one people. He was shocked to receive a
                        registered letter from her advising him of her resignation.</p>
                    <p>
                        M. Marais reported: "I was very surprised and, even more, disappointed, because I was under the
                        impression that I had been fair to her and receptive to her needs. Inasmuch as she was a friend
                        as well as an employee, I probably had taken her too much for granted and maybe was even more
                        demanding of her than of other employees.</p>
                    <p>
                        "I could not, of course, accept this resignation without some explanation. I took her aside and
                        said, ‚Paulette, you must understand that I cannot accept your resignation. You mean a great
                        deal to me and to this company, and you are as important to the success of this restaurant as I
                        am.™ I repeated this in front of the entire staff, and I invited her to my home and reiterated
                        my confidence in her with my family present.</p>
                    <p>
                        ﬁPaulette withdrew her resignation, and today I can rely on her as never before. I frequently
                        reinforce this by expressing my appreciation for what she does and showing her how important she
                        is to me and to the restaurant.ﬂ</p>
